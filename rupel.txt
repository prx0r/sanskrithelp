The Cambridge Introduction to Sanskrit
Ideal for courses in beginning Sanskrit or self-study, this textbook employs modern, tried-andtested pedagogical methods and tools, but requires no prior knowledge of ancient languages or
linguistics. Devanāgarī script is introduced over several chapters and used in parallel with transliteration for several chapters more, allowing students to progress in learning Sanskrit itself while
still mastering the script. Students are exposed to annotated original texts in addition to practice
sentences very early on, and structures and systems underlying the wealth of forms are clearly
explained to facilitate memorisation. All grammar is covered in detail, with chapters dedicated to
compounding and nominal derivation, and sections explaining relevant historical phenomena.
  Online resources include:
· Flash cards custom-made for the vocabulary and forms in the book
· Video tutorials for all chapters
· Up-to-date links to writing, declension and conjugation exercises and online dictionaries,
grammars and textual databases
A. M. Ruppel was the Townsend Senior Lecturer in the Greek, Latin and Sanskrit Languages at
Cornell University (Ithaca, NY) for nine years, and currently is Head of Sanskrit at St James Senior
Boys’ School in Ashford (Surrey), UK. Ruppel has received the Stephen and Margery Russell Distinguished Teaching Award as well as a grant from the Cornell Center for Teaching Excellence, and
is the author of Absolute Constructions in Early Indo-European (Cambridge, 2012).

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
On my own, I could not have succeeded at any stage of the work on this book. At CUP, I am indebted to Michael Sharp for suggesting I turn my teaching materials into a book, to Kate Brett for helping me with the early stages of preparing the manuscript and to the fantastic and resourceful Laura
Morris for seeing the process through to fruition. I used this book in my Introductory Sanskrit
classes at Cornell for several years, and adapted it each summer based partly on my observations
of what had worked and what hadn’t, and partly on feedback and observations of many terrific
students. Among them, my warmest thanks go to Eloïse Cucui, Sumana Raj, Aletheia Cui and
Marit Imsdahl. Several scholars who have been incredibly generous with their time have given me
valuable feedback on different parts of the manuscript. I am especially grateful to Bernhard Forssman, Sadananda Das, Jared Klein, Larry McCrea and Alan Nussbaum. Many others have helped by
offering their support and their advice on technical, literary, linguistic and pedagogical questions,
or have granted me practical support, among them Allison Boex, Charles Brittain, Harold Brown,
Koen Claeys, Eileen Daly-Boas, Nicholas Denyer, Lorraine Fitzmaurice, Coulter George, Anya
Golovkova, Ben Gravell, Erik Kenyon, Andrew Ketley, Martin Kümmel, Sabine Masanetz, Torsten
Meißner, Erich Merkel, Penny Needham and Jesse Noar. Together, they have prevented me from
making many rookie and ruki mistakes; any remaining errors are entirely my own.

CHAPTER 0
Studying Sanskrit
WHY LEARN SANSKRIT?
There are many good answers to this question. Sanskrit is studied by scholars of language, religion
and literature, by historians, sociologists and anthropologists and anyone else with an interest in
India’s cultural heritage.
Sanskrit as a language is quite simply beautiful, its structure complex enough to be interesting, but
straightforward enough to be manageable. Knowledge of Sanskrit grants access to an enormous
body of literature. Literary writing uses the means of a language to not just express a thought, but to
express it in an interesting, appealing, artful way. Thus it always is more rewarding to read a work of
literature in its original language. Yet the fact that much may be lost in translation is especially true
in relation to Sanskrit: the breadth of meaning of Sanskrit words, and the way this breadth is used in
Sanskrit poetry (especially in the form of puns and word play) sometimes make expressions or even
whole sentences or texts nearly impossible to translate. Only in the original can one truly enjoy them.
Furthermore, Sanskrit literature offers a wide window onto India: Sanskrit is the language not just of
the sacred writings of Hinduism (and some of Buddhism and Jainism), but also of many other texts
that have greatly influenced Indian culture and society over the course of more than two millennia.
This book aims to teach Sanskrit by following two principles. First of all, it attempts to minimise
the need for rote memorisation by maximising understanding of underlying structures, patterns
and similarities. As will become clear from Chapters 3 and 5, both nouns and verbs in Sanskrit have
large numbers of different forms that need to be memorised. Throughout this book, parallels will be
pointed out between new forms to be studied and forms that are already known, and various other
hints will be offered that should facilitate memorisation. Chapters dedicated to the introduction of
new forms alternate with chapters and sections explaining the processes by which the great variety
of forms comes to be (such as Chapters 7 on vowel gradation, 14 on compound nouns, 17 on noun
formation); others recommend ways of handling e.g. the abovementioned multitude of meanings
that a single word may have. While no linguistic background knowledge is required of the student,
the book offers information on the history and development of Sanskrit whenever that helps to
understand how the language as we see it works. (Such notes that may be helpful but are not crucial
if one simply wants to know what forms Sanskrit contains are printed in grey.)

Secondly, this book offers a large number of actual Sanskrit readings from its early chapters
on. The study of any ancient (or ‘dead’) language is faced with one main challenge: ancient
languages have no native speakers who could provide us with examples of simple, everyday
speech. The texts we do have are, for the most part, highly polished literature, too difficult
to read for a beginner. Many textbooks thus exclusively provide exercise sentences and texts
that were written by the author and that keep the student away from texts in the original language for months, if not for the entire length of the course. While those exercise sentences
and texts are very useful for consolidating knowledge of newly introduced grammar, going
through them does not provide anything like the thrill of reading original Sanskrit texts that
were composed 1,000, 2,000 or even 3,000 years ago and that have been studied by and have
influenced countless people across the centuries. This book introduces actual Sanskrit readings from Chapter 6 onwards. They are short and heavily annotated at first, but will soon get
longer and more varied.
Wherever this may be helpful, the book will point out parallels or noteworthy contrasts between
Sanskrit and English. The many systematic commonalities between these two languages have over
time led scholars to the realisation that these (and numerous others) all have their roots in one
common ancestor language. That ancestor is not spoken any more, is not attested in writings or
inscriptions anywhere, and we only know it through our reconstructions that are based on the material we have from the (attested) daughter languages. As a non-attested ancestor of the Indo-European languages (so-called because they stretch geographically from India in the east to Europe
in the west) it is referred to as Proto-Indo-European (or PIE for short). Each of the daughter languages is defined by the different ways in which the material from the mother language developed
into it; thus the same PIE root gives us English mother, but Sanskrit māt(a)r-; thus both Sanskrit
and English have the grammatical category of e.g. the genitive case, but express this category in
formally different ways. In short, there are numerous inherited similarities between English and
Sanskrit; when our existing knowledge of English may help us understand new Sanskrit material,
the English will be discussed explicitly, too.
HOW TO USE THIS BOOK
Notes for Teachers
An undergraduate-level course for complete beginners that meets four to five times a week will
take about one academic year to work through this book. From around Chapter 34 on, material is
introduced that will be encountered less frequently when reading Sanskrit texts; rather than covering it in the introductory year, one may thus consider coming back to it whenever a specific form
or construction is first encountered in an intermediate/reading course.
0
3
The book attempts to be as detailed as possible (partly so that students who wish to use it for selfstudy can do so). If you are trying to save in-class time, consider presenting only the necessary
core of a topic and having your students read up on the surrounding information (such as links to
already introduced material, or historical details) at home.
There are more exercises included in this book than can be covered in a normal one-year course.
This was done so that, whenever something proves difficult, a student should be able to find as
many exercises as they need to understand new material; whenever new material has been mastered, an exercise may simply be left uncompleted.
The Readings (at the end of each chapter from Chapter 6 on) were chosen so as to introduce students to actual Sanskrit, to represent a fair variety of genres (some had to be omitted because their
language would have been too challenging for students in their first year) and to be self-contained
and interesting in their own right. Often, they contain (annotated) material that is systematically
introduced only in the following chapter; thus consider doing the Readings of one chapter when
you are already going through the material of the next.
Some or all of the sandhi in the Reading passages up to Chapter 16 has been removed; note that
this makes them unmetrical. (The same applies to various passages that have been slightly changed
so as to make them intelligible to students at that point; that changes have been made is indicated
by means of an x
.)
The book introduces students to devanāgarī (the script Sanskrit is written in) right at the start,
and then gives them seven chapters of parallel use of devanāgarī and transliteration to familiarise
themselves with the script properly. To make sure no form is misread (and because there are textual editions solely in transliteration that the students may wish to use later on), both the Reference
Grammar and Vocabulary in Appendix III are given in transliteration.
Notes for Students
Like all complex matters, Sanskrit is best studied with a teacher. While it is recommended that
this book be used in a classroom context, it has been written specifically so that it can be used
for self-study. If you do the latter, the most challenging element will be pacing and motivating
yourself. Ideally, you should set yourself a certain topic to work through on a given day; but if
the possible open-endedness of this discourages you, set yourself a time goal instead: decide to
work for forty-five minutes or, on a busy day, for twenty minutes. The most important thing is
to go on and work continuously. You can do more in fifteen minutes of focussed work than you
might think.

Before you start using this book, leaf through it. Read this chapter. Turn towards the end of the
book and make a note of the resources available to you there: most importantly, there are lists (of
conjunct consonants, sandhi, forms and vocabulary) that you will make reference to quite regularly; they are marked with separate grey tabs in the margins, but you may further want to add a
sticky note or other bookmark. Directly preceding them, there are introductions to the Sanskrit
texts from which this book presents excerpts, as well as brief overviews of Sanskrit metrics, Sanskrit grammatical terminology and Vedic Sanskrit (older than the Classical Sanskrit this book introduces you to), as well a reference list of all text passages cited in this book. These latter provide
supplementary information that is not crucial, but well worth knowing about (the grammar you
study does not stem from a context-less vacuum after all); they are likely to prove especially useful
towards the end of your basic studies.
As you will see, this book contains a large number of exercises and both sentences and passages for
translation. The exercises specifically review new forms; the sentences show you new material in
context; the passages are meant to ease you into reading/translating longer texts and to expose you
to a variety of Sanskrit literary genres and sources. It is not necessary to go through all exercises etc.
before continuing on to the next chapter. Instead, you may find it helpful to return to remaining
exercises before a test, or when reviewing material at any later stage.
STUDY TECHNIQUES
No matter how well one understands the patterns behind e.g. the numerous forms of Sanskrit
nouns and verbs, the language will always remain memorisation-heavy. There are many different
tricks and techniques that will help you manage the large amount of forms that you will have to
memorise. The most frequent of these is the use of flash cards: write a Sanskrit word on one side
and its translation on the other. Go through the cards and keep those that you have trouble with in
an extra pile. Go through the extra pile repeatedly, putting cards into the first pile as they become
familiar. Do this until none of the extra pile is left. (If you find this method effective, make flash
cards also e.g. for noun or verb endings or to learn the characters of the devanāgarī.) See the section on the Cambridge Introduction to Sanskrit website below for online flash cards.
When you memorise words for corporeal things (such as a horse or an army or a village), create a
mental image of this thing as you say the Sanskrit word aloud. Recite forms out loud, from top to
bottom of a table, bottom to top, right to left or left to right. If you are a chess player, go through
a table of noun forms etc. following e.g. the Knight’s Move (two fields in one direction, one field
sideways in either direction). If you have a visual memory, colour code your tables, e.g. by making all nominative case forms blue, all accusatives red, all instrumentals green etc. (–› Chapter 5
on nominative, accusative etc.). Perhaps you will find it helpful to make flash cards of verbs from
0
5
different classes in different colours, too (–› Chapter 3 on verb classes). If you have any kind of
recording device, record yourself reading out a table or a list of vocabulary, and listen to this recording a couple of times. Small notes put up on a bathroom mirror work surprisingly well. Some
people prefer memorising just a set of grammatical endings; others find it easier to memorise a
whole set of noun or verb forms; yet others like to memorise example phrases or sentences that
contain the form(s) in question. Find out which one works best for you, and use it.
Finally, do not attempt to memorise too many words or forms at once. Set aside ten minutes to
study ten words, or fifteen to study ten new words and review the ten you studied last time. Do this
again for ten new words later in the day.
SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS
Up to Chapter 36, this book contains all the materials you need for your studies, including a full vocabulary list (starting on p. 411 in the Appendices). By the time you reach Chapter 36, you will need
to get a dictionary. A number of online dictionaries may be found at www.sanskrit-lexicon
.uni-koeln.de. An overview of other online sources may be found at http://sanskritdocuments
.org/dict.
Use of a regular dictionary is preferable, though, as that will allow you to see the context (related
words, compounds, alternative forms) of any word you look up. Also, a printed dictionary will
never encounter any problems displaying devanāgarī or transliteration or understanding which
word you are searching for; and, of course, it can be used where a computer or the internet may
not be available. A. A. Macdonell’s Practical Sanskrit Dictionary is user-friendly, and, thanks to
recent Indian reprints, both reasonably priced and readily available. It is highly recommended
for use at the intermediate level. V. S. Apte’s Practical Sanskrit–English Dictionary contains many
more details than Macdonell, yet the devanāgarī typeface is considerably less legible than that in
Macdonell (and there is no transliteration, should you prefer one). Monier Monier-Williams’ Sanskrit–English Dictionary is initially less user-friendly; yet its scope and contents make it invaluable
for serious Sanskrit study. These latter two are thus recommended for more advanced readers of
Sanskrit texts.
The Reference Grammar (in Appendix III) provides a complete overview of regular sandhi (–› Chapter 11
on sandhi), and of noun and verb forms in Classical Sanskrit. Should you want to buy a full grammar,
two good choices are A Sanskrit Grammar by William Dwight Whitney and A. A. Macdonell’s Sanskrit Grammar for Students. Both include extensive discussion of irregular forms; and while Whitney
covers both Classical Sanskrit and earlier stages of the language, Macdonell focuses on Classical Sanskrit, but includes a short and excellent summary of the differences between it and Vedic.

FURTHER STUDY – LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE
C. R. Lanman’s Sanskrit Reader offers selections from a variety of Sanskrit textual genres, complemented by explanatory notes on each passage, as well as a complete vocabulary. W. Sargeant’s edition of the Bhagavad Gītā and P. Scharf ’s edition of the Rāmopākhyāna (the summarised version of
the Rāmāyaṇa contained within the Mahābhārata; –› Literature Introductions on pp. 382–4) offer
one stanza per page, each with word-by-word translation, formal analysis and complete vocabulary. A. A. Macdonell’s A Vedic Reader for Students and Hans Henrich Hock’s An Early Upaniṣadic
Reader offer a broad selection of samples from each genre. The Clay Sanskrit Library (NYU Press/
JJL Foundation, 2005–9) includes a large variety of Sanskrit texts in transliteration and with facing
translation. If you use these, try to understand the Sanskrit as best you can, and use the facing
translation only to fill the gaps in your own translation. (Note also that they have transliteration
conventions that differ slightly from those used elsewhere.)
A good way to learn more about the many different genres of Sanskrit literature is to refer to the relevant chapters in works such as J. Gonda’s multi-volume History of Indian Literature (especially for
technical and philosophical/religious literature), M. Krishnamachariar’s History of Classical Sanskrit Literature (esp. on kāvya/court poetry) or A. A. Macdonell’s A History of Sanskrit Literature.
Furthermore, Macdonell’s Vedic Reader for Students and H. H. Hock’s An Early Upaniṣadic Reader
contain good introductions to each genre, and J. Brockington’s The Sanskrit Epics is a treasure trove
of information. Whitney’s Sanskrit Grammar, Lanman’s Reader, all of Macdonell’s works, as well as
Krishnamachariar’s History, are also available in pdf format online.
Unless otherwise noted, the original Sanskrit texts and English translations used in this book are
those of the Clay Sanskrit Library (NYU Press/JJL Foundation, 2005–9).

CHAPTER 1
Writing Sanskrit
Sanskrit is written in a very precise manner. For every sound, there is one sign, and each sign always represents the same sound. In a way, Sanskrit is thus easier to read and write than English,
where, for example, there are several different ways of pronouncing the same letters (think of thorough vs. through vs. tough), and several different ways of writing the same sound (as in meal, thief,
see, receive). The script Sanskrit is now commonly written in is known as the devanāgarī.
The meaning of this name is not quite clear. nāgarī lipiḥ means ‘urban script’. (The
macrons (the lines over ā and ī) indicate long vowels. The word lipiḥ is regularly
omitted.) Several related scripts were known under the name nāgarī. The name
devanāgarī (deva- = ‘deity; divine’) is used for this particular script, perhaps because of
its role in writing down texts of religious importance. The name of the language itself
is based on the Sanskrit word saṃskṛta- ‘composed, perfected’; the name contrasts this
language, used for religious and learned purposes, with the Prakrits, the everyday spoken
languages (prakṛta- ‘natural, normal’).
Take a look at Table 1 on p. 11. It introduces you to four kinds of information: the individual
devanāgarī characters; how they are transliterated, i.e. written with the alphabet used by, among
other languages, English; how they are pronounced; and the order in which they are conventionally listed. (Note that that order diverges from that of the English alphabet; the system behind it is
explained in Chapter 2.) This rather large amount of information is best approached in steps.
– Look over the table to get a first impression.
– Look at the pronunciation hints for each sound. Say them out loud.
– The list goes from left to right, top to bottom. A systematic explanation of labels such as ‘aspirated’
will be given in Chapter 2. A macron over a vowel (as in ā rather than a) indicates a long vowel.
– Note that, unless indicated otherwise (see p. 12), the presence of the vowel a is assumed after
any consonant.
– English does not make a conscious distinction between aspirated and unaspirated sounds.
Native speakers of English thus often find it difficult to differentiate between e.g. त ta and थ
tha. Try to add a noticeable puff of air to each aspirated sound, and let the pronunciation hints
guide you.
1
10
– Also, English does not contain any true retroflex sounds. They are similar to ‘dental’ sounds
such as t and d, but the tongue touches the roof of the mouth further at the back. To pronounce
them, curl your tongue back, then do the same as when you pronounce a t or a d. (The result is
a sound often perceived as creating a (stereo-)‘typical’ accent in Indian speakers of English.)
– Many of the hints are approximations, and you will hear slightly different pronunciations from
different speakers. Follow your teacher, but if you study on your own, remain close to these hints
and consistent in your pronunciation, and you will be fine.
STUDY THE SCRIPT
– Look at the general remarks on how to write devanāgarī characters (‘Writing single characters’,
below). Try your hand at copying a few of them (maybe ten per session): write a line of a’s, a line
of ka’s etc. Use the exercise sheets on pp. 366–72 of the book for your first attempts. http://www
.avashy.com/hindiscripttutor.htm also helps.
– Make flash cards, one for each character, with the devanāgarī on one side and the transliteration on
the other. Look at the cards with the devanāgarī side on top; pronounce each of the characters you
see. Then turn all the flash cards over so that the ‘English’ side is on top. Take a piece of paper, write
down the devanāgarī equivalent of what you see, and turn over each card to check. As always when
using flash cards, put all those cards that you have had difficulties with into a separate pile and then
go specifically through that pile. If you prefer online flash cards, go to the Cambridge Introduction
to Sanskrit website, www.cambridge-sanskrit.org. And most importantly: do not worry if you find
all of this difficult at first. You will be reading devanāgarī a lot and will get used to it soon.
WRITING SINGLE CHARACTERS
When you look over the list of characters in Table 1, you will see that many contain a horizontal
and/or a vertical line. In addition to these, there is a distinctive element that identifies the character. It is common practice to start writing a character on the left (which usually means starting
with the distinctive element), then to add the vertical line – if there is one – and to add the top
horizontal line last.
Finally, note that the devanāgarī script does not have capital letters.
Note: The vowel signs in Table 1 are used only at the beginning of a word when no other consonant
precedes. The signs for vowels in other positions are given in Table 2. Also note that the r and l
sounds may function both as vowels and as consonants in Sanskrit. When they are used as vowels,
they are written in transliteration as ṛ (long ṝ) and ḷ. You will see the difference in usage when reading actual words in the coming chapters.

be discussed further in this book.

Similar Characters
The following pairs of characters look very similar and may thus initially cause confusion:
भ bha and म ma ब ba and व va थ tha and य ya ख kha and रव ra-va
घ gha and ध dha प pa and ष ṣa ङ ṅa and ड ḍa उ u and ज ja
If you remember that each of these can be confused with another sign, it will be easier to notice any
mistakes you may have made reading words that contain them (and an unknown thoga will turn
out to be yoga, etc.)
Devanāgarī Mnemonics
As you have seen by now, the devanāgarī script consists of a large number of signs that to most
learners are completely new. When memorising them, break them up into elements that you
can recognise more easily. अ a, for example, is like the number 3 connected to a capital T. इ
i consists of the top line, a small connector and a capital S with a squiggle at the bottom. उ u
looks similar to a number 3 with a flat top line and a slight extension at the bottom. ग ga, in addition to the line at the top and the downward stroke shared by so many devanāgarī characters,
has as its characteristic element something that looks like a golf club; this may also help you
remember that ग ga always represents a hard g (as in e.g. golf), never a soft one (as in e.g. gin).
Different mnemonics work for different people; come up with as many of them as you find
useful.
You may now do Exercise 1.
WRITING WORDS
a) Combining Consonants and Vowels
There is one distinct difference between devanāgarī and the alphabet used by e.g. English: in
English writing, all letters are equal, and written one after the other. Yet in devanāgarī, there is a
difference between the representation of consonants and that of vowels: the ‘main’ signs represent consonants. The sign for the vowel following a consonant is then added to the right, to the
left, above or below the consonant sign. There is no sign indicating the vowel a: given that this
is the most frequent vowel in Sanskrit, it apparently seemed most economical to have its presence ‘assumed’ whenever no other vowel was explicitly indicated. The absence of a vowel after
a consonant is indicated by the virāma (literally ‘stop, end’), a small diagonal stroke below the
consonant sign: e.g. क्k (vs. क ka from Table 1). For examples of vowels other than a, compare:
क्k + ी ī = की kī    क्k + ृ ṛ = कृkṛ
1
13
Table 2: Combining consonants and vowels
क ka का kā कि ki की kī कु ku कू kū कृ kṛ कॄ kṝ
कॢ kḷ (कॣ kḷ‐
) के ke कै kai को ko कौ kau कः kaḥ कं kaṃ
Notice particularly the sign for short i, which is always added before the consonant after which it is
pronounced:
क्k + ि i = कि ki
Table 2 presents an overview of all such vowel signs.
Generally, vowel signs look identical no matter which consonant they are combined with. Yet there
are two noteworthy exceptions: the signs for u/ū and ṛ/ṝ are usually attached to the bottom of the
vertical line of the consonant sign. Yet, by convention, the vowels in hṛ and ru/rū are placed within
the consonant signs:
हृ hṛ रु ru रू rū
The vowel signs just described (the ‘dependent’ vowel signs) may only be used when the vowel
follows upon a consonant. When a vowel has no preceding consonant sign to attach to, as may be
possible at the beginning of a word, we have to use the ‘independent’ or initial vowel signs (e.g. अ,
आ etc.) listed at the top of Table 1.
You may now do Exercise 2.
b) Visarga and Anusvāra
Note the two signs in the bottom right-hand corner of Table 2. -ḥ and -ṃ do not appear at the beginning of words; hence there are no independent signs for them. -ḥ, the visarga, is often pronounced
similar to the -ch in German Bach or Scottish loch, but slightly weaker; you may also hear it pronounced like a standard -h-, with a weak repetition of the preceding vowel (making e.g. नरः naraḥ
‘man’ [naraha]). -ṃ, the anusvāra, is not a sound of its own, but nasalises the preceding vowel,
making e.g. -aṃ sound approximately like French grand.
The following words exemplify the aspects of the devanāgarī described so far:
महाराजः mahārājaḥ ‘great king’ Note that the short -a- in the first and fourth
syllables is not explicitly indicated.
1
14
हिमालयः Himālayaḥ Note that the sign for the -i- is written before the
(the mountain range) sign for the -h-, but pronounced after it.
गुरुः guruḥ ‘teacher’ Note that the -u- looks different when combined
with -r-.
अशोकः Aśokaḥ (an Indian emperor) Note the form of the vowel a- at the beginning of
the word.
हंसः haṃsaḥ ‘goose’ or ‘swan’ Note the dot indicating the anusvāra in haṃ-.
c) Combining Consonants
Finally, we need to look at conjunct consonants. In a word such as महाराजः mahārājaḥ ‘great king’,
every consonant is followed by a vowel. But in a word such as maṇḍalaḥ ‘circle’, the -ṇ- is directly
followed by a -ḍ-. If we wrote this as + मणडलः, it would spell +
maṇaḍalaḥ.
One way of indicating that there is no vowel following upon a consonant is to employ the virāma
(see above), yet, by convention, this is done almost exclusively at the end of words whose last sound
is a consonant. Within words, however, the signs for individual consonants are linked. Usually,
this is done by omitting the right-hand vertical element of the first sign:
ण्ṇ + ड्ḍ = ण्ड् -ṇḍ- मण्डलः maṇḍalaḥ ‘circle’
The same happens in the word ātmā ‘soul’:
त्t + म्m = त्म्-tm- आत्मा ātmā ‘soul, self ’
This also works in a combination of three or more consonants:
त्t + म्m + य्y = त्म -्य् tmy- as in माहात्म्यम्māhātmyam ‘magnanimity, generosity’
Sometimes, a letter does not have a vertical element, or cannot be combined with the next letter for
some other reason. In these cases, letters may be made smaller and stacked on top of one another.
Some examples:
क्k + क ka = क्क kka द्d + म ma = द्म dma द्d + भ bha = द्भ dbha
द्d + य ya = द्य dya न्n + न na = न्न nna प्p + त ta = प्त pta
Some conjunct consonant signs cannot be recognised on the basis of the regular forms of the single
consonants and must thus be memorised. They are the following:
– r before other consonants: a small hook in the top right-hand corner of the following syllable
sign (consonant + vowel): अर्जुनः Arjunaḥ (name); दर्ु योगः duryogaḥ ‘crime’. Do not confuse this
sign with the (identical-looking) hook on the sign for initial ī, ई.
1
15
– r after other consonants: a small diagonal line in lower half of adjacent consonant: क्रोधः krodhaḥ
‘anger’; भ्राता bhrātā ‘brother’; especially in combination with -t-: अत्र atra ‘here’ (in some other
fonts, this appears as �).
– ś before some other consonants: a small loop in top left corner: अश्वः aśvaḥ ‘horse’; पश्चात्paścāt
‘after’; श्री śrī ‘beauty; happiness’
– kṣ क् as in ष् क्त्रम् षे kṣetram ‘field’
– jñ ज् as in ञ् ज्ञानम्  jñānam ‘knowledge’
– tt त् as in त् उत्तमः uttamaḥ ‘highest’
– kt क्त् as in भक्तिः bhaktiḥ ‘devotion’ (in other fonts, this appears as �).
A list of all common conjunct consonants is given in larger print on pp. 385–6 in the Appendices.
It may look daunting, but you will soon find that you hardly need it: the single elements of most
conjuncts are easily recognisable. Only a handful of characters change their shape noticeably when
combined with others; see the list above and in the Nutshell below. These are the only elements that
need to be individually memorised (if you find flash cards helpful, make cards of these conjuncts).
If you want to be particularly thorough, go through the list while covering the transliterations with
your hand. Make your own list, or set of flash cards, of all the conjuncts you do not recognise. Go
over that list again.
To write words: Conjunct consonants
– Take a consonant sign.
– Add a vowel sign before, after, above or
below it.
– If a consonant follows instead of a vowel,
combine the two signs to form a conjunct
consonant.
– If a word begins with a vowel, use an independent vowel sign.
– Consonant signs combine and change their
form when two consonants stand directly
next to each other.
– Often, consonant signs are combined by
omission of the vertical stroke of the first
consonant.
– If that is not possible, one may be written on
top of the other.

CHAPTER 2
The System of Sanskrit Sounds
While you are still learning to write the devanāgarī characters, read through this chapter. It offers
more details on pronunciation and introduces you to some technical terminology concerning the
sounds of Sanskrit. Our focus is on studying the Sanskrit language itself, yet you will see throughout your study why it makes sense to not just know which sounds Sanskrit contains, but also what
the relationships between these sounds are.
For example, the traditional order of the devanāgarī signs as laid down by the ancient Sanskrit
grammarians is based on those relationships.
Table 3: Linguistic labels of the Sanskrit sounds
simple
complex
velar
palatal
retroflex
dental
labial
unvoiced
unaspirated

This order of Sanskrit sounds works along three principles: it goes from simple to complex; it goes
from the back to the front of the mouth; and it groups similar sounds together.
First come the vowels, then the consonants. Vowels are ‘simpler’ than consonants as they can easily
be pronounced on their own, while consonants usually need the help of a vowel to be pronounced.
Think of how you pronounce e and b: when you pronounce the vowel e, you just say e, whereas if
you pronounce the consonant b, what you say will sound more like the word be, i.e. you add an e to
the b-sound itself. That is why b is counted among the ‘consonants’, literally those ‘that sound along,
whose sound is accompanied by another’. Among themselves, both the vowels and the consonants
are ordered according to where in the mouth they are pronounced, going from back to front.
VOWELS
a is pronounced in the low back of the mouth, i is pronounced higher up, u then is pronounced
with a rounding of your lips and thus, in a way, further to the front of the mouth. Next there are
the vowel (or ‘vocalic’) forms of r and l, written in transliteration as ṛ and ḷ. Each sound is given
first in its short, then in its long variant: a ā i ī u ū ṛ ṝ ḷ (ḷ
 ̄). All these are known as the simple vowels.
They are followed by the complex vowels, e ai o au. At an earlier stage of the language, e and o actually were *ai and *au, and current ai and au once were *āi and *āu. Knowing that e ai o au were
once *ai *āi *au *āu allows us to understand not only why all four of these are known as ‘complex’
vowels (all of them once actually were vowel combinations or ‘diphthongs’), but also to see that the
pattern of ‘short vowel, then long vowel’ that we saw in a ā i ī etc. is maintained here, too. All four
complex vowels count as long.
CONSONANTS
a) Stops
Among the consonants, we first get the stops. Their name derives from the fact that, in order to pronounce them, we stop and then release the flow of air at some point in our mouth. First come the velar
stops or velars, formed by briefly stopping the air in the back of our throats (at the so-called velum).
Then come the palatals (the tongue touches the hard palate, or roof of the mouth), the retroflex
stops (tongue ‘retroflected’, i.e. curled back and touching the roof of the mouth), the dentals (tongue
touches teeth; dent- = Latin ‘tooth’), and the labials (lower and upper lips touch; labia = Latin ‘lip’).
In each of these ‘places of articulation’ we find several different stops. They are traditionally listed in
the order of unvoiced unaspirated – voiced unaspirated – unvoiced aspirated – voiced aspirated,
thus in a way proceeding from ‘simple’ to ‘complex’. ‘Voiced’ means that the vocal cords vibrate
20
2
when the sound is pronounced: put a finger on your throat and say the letters d and t. When you
say d, you will feel a vibration, which is absent when you say t. This vibration is what we call voice.
Sounds that have it are called ‘voiced’; those that do not, ‘unvoiced’.
Alternatively, as English never aspirates its voiced stops, you can try the following method: hold
your hand flat in front of your mouth and say ‘ta’ and ‘da’ (or ‘ka’ and ‘ga’, etc.). Whenever you feel
a strong puff of air, you can know that a stop is unvoiced; where the puff of air is weak, the stop is
voiced.
The difference between aspirated and unaspirated sounds is more difficult to explain because English does not consciously make this distinction. Basically, ‘aspirated’ means that a sound is accompanied by air. Hold your hand in front of your mouth and say the word pot. The puff of air that you
feel emerging when you pronounce the p is its aspiration. You find an almost unaspirated p in the
word spot: notice there is nearly no puff of air accompanying that p. You should try to make this
kind of distinction between all pairs of aspirated and unaspirated stops. If, like most native speakers of English, you find this difficult, pronounce Sanskrit p as you would the p in pot, and then add
a more noticeable aspiration to pronounce ph, kh etc.
Three things to note: One, Sanskrit th must not be confused with the English th in words such as
the or thanks. Parallel to other aspirated stops, th is pronounced as a t with a puff of air accompanying it. Two, even though aspirated stops are transliterated into English with two letters (as kh, gh,
ch, etc.), they are one sound only. And finally, as English has no aspirated voiced stops (such as gh,
bh), don’t worry if you find them difficult to pronounce at first. Follow the pronunciation hints in
Chapter 1, and you will soon be comfortable with them.
b) Nasals
After each series of stops there are the respective nasals, so called because the pathway from the
oral to the nasal cavity at the back of our mouth is open when they are pronounced. Other than
that, they are parallel to their corresponding stops: the velar nasal is pronounced in the same place
as the velar stops, the palatal nasal as the palatal stops, and so on.
c) Semivowels/Glides
Next come the remaining consonants, once again ordered according to where in the mouth they
are pronounced. First, there are the sounds that have vowel equivalents: -y-, -r-, -l- and -v-.
They correspond to the vowels -i-/-ī-, -ṛ-/-ṝ-, -ḷ- and -u-/-ū-: whenever these vowels come to
stand before a vowel other than themselves, they change into their consonantal forms (thus, i
changes into y (e.g. i + a –› ya), u into v, ṛ into r, and ḷ into l; you will see numerous examples
21
2
of this from Chapter 7 onwards). These sounds are called glides, liquids or semivowels (literally
‘half-vowels’).
d) Sibilants and h
Next come the three kinds of sibilant, or s-sound: the palatal ś, the retroflex ṣ, and the dental s.
(Note that they are listed in the same order as the corresponding stops.) Finally, there is h, which
is pronounced more or less as h is in English. The sound is voiced (unlike in English, where h is
unvoiced), yet an unvoiced pronunciation is predominant now.
Note: Do not confuse the h with visarga (ḥ), in spite of how similarly they are transliterated into
English.
USE OF THIS CHAPTER FOR REFERENCE
At this point, the information in this chapter may seem superfluous; yet later on it will be very useful to understand the systematics just outlined. Understanding the traditional order of the sounds/
letters makes memorising it easier (and you will need to know this order when you use a dictionary or word list). Yet more importantly, it will help you understand the relations between various
words and word forms: in Sanskrit, numerous words are formed from the same base. For example,
based on √भज्bhaj (a verbal ‘root’, thus marked with the root symbol √ and properly introduced in
Chapter 3) meaning ‘to allot, give to; to honour, worship’, we find words such as -भाज्- -bhāj- ‘worshipping’, भाग- bhāga- ‘portion, allotment’, भक्ति- bhakti- ‘giving out; worship’, and many others.
In these related forms, we see that a palatal consonant appears as its velar counterpart (-bhāj- vs.
bhāga-), and a voiced consonant appears as its voiceless counterpart (bhāga- vs. bhakti-) before
another voiceless sound. Both of these correspondences occur very frequently. Also, knowing
about the relationship between the vowels u/ū and their consonantal counterpart v, we shall see
how the -ū- in the verbal root भू- bhū- ‘to be’ and its semivocalic equivalent, -v-, in the verb form
भवति bhavati ‘he/she/it is’ correspond (–› Chapter 7 for more details on this). When we are familiar
with the links between simple and complex vowels, we understand how words such as the root
चोर- cora- ‘thief ’ and चौर्य- caurya- ‘robbery’ can be formed from the root √चुर्cur ‘to take, steal’. In
short, we gain a better understanding, rather than just knowledge, of the Sanskrit language. We also
greatly decrease the amount of vocabulary we shall have to memorise.
More detailed discussion of the ways in which sounds correspond to each other can be
found in Chapters 7 (vowel gradation), 11, 13 and 16 (sandhi), and 17 (noun formation,
especially vṛddhi derivatives).

CHAPTER 2A
Word Stress: Heavy and Light Syllables
Sanskrit inherited a system of accentuation from its mother language, Proto-IndoEuropean, in which the placement of the accent followed certain word-based rules; no
general statement concerning accent placement could be made. Yet this accent, which
furthermore was not a stress, but a pitch accent (meaning that the accented syllable was
higher in tone/pitch than the other syllables) was lost, and the systems described below
were generally adapted in its place.
In all English words that are stressed (i.e. that have a syllable which is pronounced more strongly),
the stress is clearly audible; yet by looking at the word, you will not be able to predict which of its
syllables is stressed: for example, you simply have to know that the word record is stressed on the
first syllable (record) when it is a noun, but on the second syllable (record) when it is a verb. In
Sanskrit, word stress is predictable, but weaker, and depends on the ‘weight’ (or ‘length’) of the
syllables in a word.
LIGHT AND HEAVY SYLLABLES
A syllable always contains a vowel, and usually also consonants before and/or after it. If there is just
one consonant between vowels, it counts as standing at the beginning of a syllable: the word भरति
bharati ‘he carries’, for example, is thus split up into the syllables bha, ra and ti. When a word contains two or more consonants adjacent to one another (as in the name शकुन्तला Śakuntalā), all but
the last consonant are counted as part of the second syllable (Śa-kun-ta-lā). (The same applies to
English: think about how you might pronounce and split up words such as woman, fundamental,
captain, function etc.)
We distinguish two kinds of syllable: ‘heavy’ and ‘light’ (also referred to as ‘long and ‘short’). A
syllable counts as ‘heavy’ when it contains a long or complex vowel (ā ī ū ṝ e ai o au), when its vowel
is followed by more than one consonant (and thus it ends in a consonant itself), or when it contains a vowel followed by anusvāra or visarga. A syllable counts as light if it contains a short vowel
2A
26
(a i u ṛ ḷ) that is followed by only one consonant (which would belong to the following syllable).
Compare the following examples:
भरति bharati ‘he carries’ This contains the syllables bha-ra-ti. All of these are light:
each contains a short vowel (a – a – i), and these vowels are
followed by no more than one consonant.
कथा kathā ‘story’ This contains the syllables ka-thā. The first is light, the
second is heavy, as it contains a long vowel. (Remember that
even though थ is written with two consonants in English
(tha), it is only one sound in Sanskrit.)
भरामि bharāmi ‘I carry’ This contains the syllables bha-rā-mi. bha and mi count as
light; rā on the other hand contains a long vowel (ā) and thus
counts as heavy.
शकुन्तला Śakuntalā (a name) This contains the syllables Śa-kun-ta-lā. The second and last
syllables are heavy: kun because it ends in a consonant, lā
because it contains a long vowel.
स्वयंवरः svayaṃvaraḥ ‘self-choice’ This contains the syllables sva-yaṃ-va-raḥ. The third-last
syllable yaṃ is heavy because it contains a vowel that is
followed by an anusvāra. (‘Self-choice’ is the name for the
ceremony in which a woman chooses a husband for herself.)
WHICH SYLLABLE IS STRESSED?
In the West, the system usually employed for Sanskrit word stress is the following: if the second-last
syllable of a word is heavy, it is stressed. If it is light, the stress will go further back to the third-last
syllable. If a word has fewer than three syllables, the accent simply goes as far back as it can. Compare the following examples:
भरामि bharāmi mi is the last syllable, rā the second-last; rā contains a long vowel and thus
counts as heavy; therefore it is stressed: bharāmi.
भरति bharati The second-last syllable, ra, is light; hence the stress goes on to the thirdlast syllable, bha: bharati. This third-last syllable is light, but the accent
cannot go any further back.
शकुन्तला Śakuntalā The second-last syllable, ta, is light; hence the accent goes back to the
third-last syllable, kun. This syllable ends in a consonant and thus counts as
heavy; hence the accent remains there: Śakuntalā.

27
EXERCISES
1) Read the text below, making sure to differentiate between light and heavy syllables. Either
put the main stress on the relevant syllable (if it helps you, indicate this stress with a dash´),
or identify and give weight to each heavy syllable.
सर्गाणाम् आदिः अन्तः च मध्यम् च एव अहम्अर्जुन ।
of creations beginning end and middle and indeed I (o) Arjuna
अध्यात्मविद्या विद्यानाम् वादः प्रवदताम् अहम् ॥
supreme self-knowledge of knowledges argument of speakers I
अक्षराणाम् अकारः अस्मि द्वन्द्वः सामासिकस्य च ।
of characters the letter A I am dvandva of compounding and
अहम् एव अक्षयः कालः धाता अहम् विश्वतोमुखः ॥
I indeed infinite time arranger I everywhere-facing
मृत्युः सर्वहरः च अहम् उद्भवः च भविष्यताम् ।
death all-taking and I beginning and of what-will-be
कीर्तिः   श्रीः वाक् च नारीणाम् स्मृतिः मेधा धृतिः क्षमा ॥
fame prosperity speech and women/ memory wisdom constancy patience
feminines
‘I am the beginning, the end, and also the middle of the creations, Arjuna; of kinds of
knowledge, I am the knowledge of the self, of speakers I am the speech. Of written characters, I am “a”, and of compounds the aggregate [see dvandva in Chapter 14]. I myself
am indestructible Time, I am the arranger facing everywhere. And I am death that takes
everyone, and the source of what is yet to come. Of feminine things, I am glory, fortune,
An alternative method is to not assign one stress to each word, but to give more weight to each
heavy syllable, no matter how many there may be in a word. Thus, in the Mahābhārata (the name
of an epic poem), the second and third syllables are both given more weight/stress; the same with
the second and last syllables in Śakuntalā. This method is maybe used more rarely in the West
because it is unparalleled in its classical languages.

speech, memory, wisdom, constancy and patience.’ (Note: All nouns in the last sentence
are of feminine gender –› Chapter 5.)

2) Transliterate the following four stanzas from the Bhagavad-Gītā.
(This exercise is challenging, as the words in this text are combined according to the rules of
sandhi, which will only be introduced in Chapter 11. It is intended to give you practice reading
long strings of characters. Do not pay attention to word stress here.)

‘And so, always yoking himself, the yogī,
his mind in check, attains the peace
that ends in nirvāṇa, and abides in me.
Yoga isn’t for those who eat too much,
nor just for those who don’t eat; it isn’t
for those who tend to sleep too much,
Arjuna, nor for those who stay awake.
For him who is moderate in food and
sport, disciplined in activities and
regulated in sleeping and waking, yoga
is the destroyer of suffering. When the
restrained mind settles down within the
self alone, then, free from craving for all
objects of desire, one is called a yogī.’

CHAPTER 3
Road Map: Verbs
A verb, broadly speaking, is a word that expresses an action (such as English sheruns, I am singing,
they laughed).
This section will give an overview of (1) what kinds of information Sanskrit verb forms can express
and (2) how they express them. This involves introducing some new concepts and terminology. It
will be helpful to read this section more than once: when you have read everything through and
looked at the examples at the bottom, the first paragraphs may make more sense than when you
first read them.
1) THE CATEGORIES OF THE SANSKRIT VERB
We say that the Sanskrit verb is ‘marked for’ – that is, uses different forms to express – the following
grammatical categories: person and number; tense, mood and voice.
In the category of person, Sanskrit and English alike differentiate between first, second and third.
The first person refers to the speaker (‘I’); the second to the person spoken to (‘you’); and the third
person to someone or something spoken about (‘he/she/it’). Again like English, Sanskrit has a
singular and a plural number: the singular refers to just one thing or person (‘I’, ‘she’, ‘the chocolate
cake’ etc.), while the plural refers to several (‘we’, ‘they’, ‘the cats’ etc.). Yet unlike English, Sanskrit
also has a dual number, used to refer to exactly two of something; this should be translated into
English either exactly as e.g. ‘we two, the two of us’, ‘the two of them’, ‘the two brothers’, or simply
as a plural ‘we’, ‘they’, ‘the brothers’.
Tense is the term for time as it is expressed in verbs. Once again like English, Sanskrit verbs can
refer to the present (such as ‘I run’), and are then said to stand in the present tense; they can refer
to the future (‘I will run’); or they can refer to the past (‘I ran’). Sanskrit has several ways of referring to the past; these various tenses (referred to as imperfect, aorist and perfect, respectively) are
formed in different ways, but generally express the same thing: an action that took place prior to
the present. Unlike English, Sanskrit does not make a distinction between ‘simple’ and ‘continuous’
forms (such as English ‘I run’ vs. ‘I am running’; ‘I ran’ vs. ‘I was running’; ‘I will run’ vs. ‘I will be
3
30
running’). Depending on the context, a Sanskrit verb form such as भरति bharati may thus have to
be translated as either ‘(he) carries’ or ‘(he) is carrying’.
The different moods of a verb express different kinds of utterance: while the indicative is basically
used for statements about reality, i.e. things that are (such as ‘You are going to the city’), the potential
generally expresses possibilities or wishes, i.e. things that could be (‘You should/might/could go to
the city’, ‘If you go to the city…’, or even a future-like ‘You will go to the city’). The Sanskrit potential
is regularly used only in the present tense. It is sometimes called the subjunctive or the optative. The
imperative mood expresses commands and strong wishes (‘Go to the city!’, ‘Let him go to the city!’).
Voice is the term that covers active (‘I carry’) and passive (‘I am carried’). Sanskrit also has a third
voice, the middle. At an earlier stage of the language, its function was somewhere in ‘the middle’ of
active and passive. Yet this distinction in meaning was lost, and only the separate set of middle forms
survived. This may sound confusing now, yet the question of how to treat and translate middle forms
will be discussed in great detail when the middle is introduced in Chapter 21. In relation to voice,
you are likely to hear also the terminology introduced by the ancient Indian grammarians: parasmaipada, lit. ‘word for another’, is the ‘active’ and ātmanepada, lit. ‘word for oneself ’, is the middle.
In addition to basic verb forms there also are ‘secondary’ or ‘derived’ verb forms: on the basis of e.g.
‘he carries’, there also is a causative ‘he causes (someone) to carry’ and a desiderative ‘he desires/
wants to carry’.
Finite and Non-Finite Verb Forms
Any verb form that is marked for all of the above categories is called finite. Compare English examples of finite verbs such as I will go, which is 1st (person) singular (number) future (tense) indicative
(mood) active (voice) or they would be carried (3rd plural present subjunctive passive).
In addition to these finite forms, there are non-finite verb forms, so called as they are less finite/
definite in the information they convey: the most frequent of these are the infinitive (compare the
English infinitive ‘to go’) used in Sanskrit mostly after finite verbs in expressions such as ‘I want to
go’ or ‘I am able to go’, several participles (comparable to English participles: ‘doing’ (present active); ‘having done’ (past active); ‘having been done’ (past passive)), and the absolutive (also called
the ‘gerund’, and similar in function to a past active participle: ‘having done’). Participles and the
absolutive are extremely frequent in Sanskrit. Finally, the gerundive expresses the idea of ‘passive
necessity’, i.e. ‘having to be done; (which) should/must be done’.
Note that the participles and the gerundive are declined (–› Chapter 5) like adjectives,
while the absolutive and infinitive (–› Chapter 8) both have only one form for each verb.
3
31
2) HOW THESE CATEGORIES ARE EXPRESSED
As we have just seen, verbs in Sanskrit and English express more or less the same information: Sanskrit verbs, just like their English counterparts, tell us who is doing something (person, number),
when this is done (tense) and how it is done (mood, voice).
The main difference lies in how the two languages express this information. As a general rule,
English adds small independent words before the verb form itself, while Sanskrit adds affixes and
endings, elements that cannot stand on their own. Compare the following:
3
32
TECHNICAL NOTE I: VERBAL ROOTS, STEMS AND VERB CLASSES
In a dictionary or vocabulary list, a verb is listed under its so-called root (which is typically marked
using the √ symbol also employed for roots in mathematics). Roots are abstract forms arrived at by
grammarians: the root of a verb is its minimal form, the element that conveys the basic meaning of
the verb, left over when all markers of person, number, tense, voice and mood have been removed.
For example: √अस् as is the root of the verb ‘to be’. This form is not actually ever encountered in any
sentence or text; instead, one finds only complete forms such as अस्मि asmi ‘I am’ or अस्ति asti ‘he
is’ (with the endings -mi and -ti marking these forms as 1st and 3rd person singular, respectively).
Some verbs add endings straight onto the root. Yet in most verbs, the form of the root itself is
changed before endings are added to it. These changes involve adding something before, into or
behind the root. The form of the verb onto which the actual endings are then added is called the
verbal stem. (In the case of verbs to whose root we find endings added directly, we say that the stem
is identical to the root, or refer to it as a root stem.) To give some examples of this very abstract
account: the verb √अस्as ‘to be’ adds endings directly to the unchanged root; the verb √विश्viś ‘to
enter’ adds the vowel -a- after the stem; the verb √दा dā ‘to give’ adds the syllable da- in front of the
root. Thus the 3rd Sg Present of each verb looks as follows:
Root Stem Ending Full form
√अस्as अस्- as- -ति -ti अस्ति asti ‘he/she/it is’
√विश्viś विश- viśa- -ति -ti विशति viśati ‘he/she/it enters’
√दा dā ददा- dadā- -ति -ti ददाति dadāti ‘he/she/it gives’
1) a) you carry
b) they carry
भरसि bharasi
भरन्तिbharanti
The category of person is expressed by an
independent word (you, they etc.) in English,
but by an ending (-si,-nti etc.) in Sanskrit.
2) a) you carry
b) you will carry
भरसि bharasi
भरिष्यसि bhariṣyasi
The same is the case for tense: just as English
expresses the difference between present
(I carry) and future (I will carry) by adding an
extra word (will) between the element expressing person (I) and the verb (carry), so does
Sanskrit add a suffix (here: -iṣya-) between the
stem of the verb (bhar-) and the ending (-si)
that indicates person and number.
English Sanskrit
3
33
Sanskrit actually has not just three, but ten different ways of forming such present verbal stems. As
we have just seen, these additions do not change the meaning of the root; the changes are purely
formal. All the roots that form their present stem in the same way are said to be in the same Stem
or Verb Class. Roots often belong to just one class, but many have forms made according to different classes. From looking at a root, one cannot know which class(es) it belongs to. Hence this
information is provided in any dictionary or vocabulary list and needs to be memorised. A complete dictionary entry for a verb would look as follows:
Root Verb class 3rd Sg Present Meaning
√दा dā (III ददाति dadāti) ‘to give’
Note that not just the verb class, but also a form containing the actual present stem (by convention:
the 3rd Sg Present Indicative Active) are listed. This is necessary because the form of the present
stem may be irregular.
TECHNICAL NOTE II: AFFIXES AND ENDINGS
To clarify some terminology: an affix can be added anywhere to a stem or a verbal root, whether
before it (a prefix), into it (an infix) or after it (a suffix). An ending is always added after the stem
and, more importantly, creates a complete verb (or noun) form: thus, भरिष्यसि bhariṣyasi above
contains the future suffix -iṣya- and the 2nd Sg ending -si.
TECHNICAL NOTE III: PUNCTUATION MARKS
While English has a full array of punctuation marks – commas, full stops, question marks, exclamation marks etc. – Sanskrit does with only two signs. । (called a daṇḍa ‘stick’) marks the end of
any sentence (and thus is the equivalent of a full stop, exclamation mark and question mark – by
looking at the context, you will be able to determine what kind of sentence you are looking at). In
metrical texts, । is used to mark the end of a line, whereas ॥ marks the end of a metrical unit (such
as a stanza). In prose texts, ॥ may be used to mark the end of a paragraph, story etc.

(Given that we have not learned any actual verb forms yet, the verbs in this section will not be
given by reference to their root and root class; instead, you find their 3rd Sg Pres Ind Act. The
relevant roots will be introduced in future chapters.)

 The third-person ending can always refer to a man, woman or thing; only the context tells us
which one it is in a specific context. This book will use ‘he’ as shorthand for the more correct, but
also unwieldy, ‘he/she/it’.
2 Postposed means ‘placed after’. This term is used for words that appear after the word before which
they must be translated e.g. in English. For example, गच्छति भरति च gacchati bharati ca, literally ‘he
goes he carries and’ must be translated as ‘he goes and carries’. Also, compare न बोधति na bodhati
‘he does not understand’ and न तु बोधति na tu bodhati lit. ‘not but he understands’, i.e. ‘but he does
not understand’. A postposed element may be put behind the first word in a phrase or sense unit,
or follow later on, but may not come first: अत्र स्मरति तत्र च विशति atra smarati tatra ca viśati ‘here he
remembers and there he enters’ or अत्र स्मरति तत्र विशति च atra smarati tatra viśati ca, but not +
 अत्र स्मरति
च तत्र विशति atra smarati ca tatra viśati.

VERBAL ENDINGS OF THE PRESENT INDICATIVE ACTIVE
As outlined in the Road Map in Chapter 3, verbs in Sanskrit express the same kind of grammatical
information as their English counterparts, but do so in a different way: while English adds separate words in front of the verb itself (as in I go or they will go), Sanskrit mostly adds suffixes and
personal endings at the end of a verb form. This chapter introduces the endings for the present
indicative active, which are as follows:
These endings are used by all active verb forms in Sanskrit. Memorise them, starting with the first
person singular, going down each column (-mi, -si, -ti) and then moving over to the next column.
Distinguish the pronunciation of -thaḥ and -taḥ, which otherwise become easy to confuse.
CLASS I, IV, VI VERBS
As mentioned before, there are different ways in which Sanskrit verbal roots form the present tense
stem to which these endings are added. These different ways are referred to as different verb classes.
Classes I, IV and VI are formally similar and are thus treated together here. Their present tense
stems are formed as follows:
Class I: The vowel -a- is added into the root before the root vowel; then -a- is added
after the root.
Examples: √भृbhṛ ‘to carry’, root vowel: -ṛ-; present stem भर- bhara-.
(Next to another vowel, the vowel -ṛ- becomes the consonant -r-; see ‘Semivowels’, Chapter 2.)

√बुध्budh ‘to awake’, root vowel -u-; present stem बोध- bodha-.
 (Note: -a- inserted before -u- –› *-au-, which appears as -o-; see ‘Complex
Vowels’, Chapter 2.)
Class IV: The root itself remains as it is; -ya- is added to it.
Example: √हृष्hṛṣ ‘to be excited’; present stem हृ - hṛṣya-.
Class VI: Either: the root itself usually remains as it is; -a- is added to it.
Example: √विश्viś ‘to enter’; present stem विश- viśa-.
Or: a nasal is added before the final consonant of the root; -a- is added to it.
Examples: √मुच्muc ‘to release’ –› present stem मु - muñca-.
√विद्vid ‘to find’ –› present stem िव�द- vinda-.
√लुप्lup ‘to take, steal’ –› present stem लु�प- lumpa-.
Note that which one of the nasals appears in Class VI roots depends on the nature of their final consonants: the palatal nasal ñ is added in front of a palatal stop, the dental nasal n in front of a dental stop, etc.
Combining these verbal stems with the endings introduced above, we arrive at the paradigm (i.e. the
complete list of forms) of the present indicative active of these verbs. Take for example √भृ ‘to carry’:
Present active indicative of √भृ ‘to carry’
Singular Dual Plural
1st भरामि bharāmi भरावः bharāvaḥ भरामः bharāmaḥ
2nd भरसि bharasi भरथः bharathaḥ भरथ bharatha
3rd भरति bharati भरतः bharataḥ भरन्तिbharanti
Note that the first-person forms in all numbers contain a long -ā- before the ending: bharāmi, not
+
bharami etc. This is the case across all Class I, IV and VI verbs (as well as Class X –› Chapter 7).
TECHNICAL NOTE: SANDHI
When Sanskrit words appear in a sentence, the final sound of each word changes slightly according
to what sound the next word begins with. This process is called sandhi and will be explained in
detail in Chapters 11, 13 and 16. Two frequent sandhi manifestations will be introduced already at
4
this point: 1) word-final -m appears as -m when the next word begins with a vowel, but as anusvāra
(nasalised -ṃ –› Chapter 1) when the next word begins with a consonant. Thus we find e.g. किम् अत्र
kim atra ‘what (is) here?’, but किं तत्र kiṃ tatra ‘what (is) there?’ This difference is made throughout the exercises from now on. 2) Word-final -s sometimes appears as -s, but may also appear in
a variety of other forms. When a word stands on its own with nothing else following it, -s appears
as visarga (i.e. -ḥ). This book will follow the convention that all words originally ending in -s are
introduced in their sandhied form, i.e. ending in -ḥ. (This has already been done in some of the
verbal endings, which underlyingly are *-vas, *-thas, *-tas and *-mas.)
Sandhi of -m and -s
Word-final -m appears as -m when the next word begins with a vowel, but as -ṃ when the next
word begins with a consonant: किम् अत्र kim atra, but किं तत्र kiṃ tatra.
When a word ending in -s is not followed by another word, that -s appears as -ḥ.

CHAPTER 5
Road Map: Nominals
DEFINITION
The category of ‘nominal’ forms includes several kinds of word:
– nouns, also called substantives (such as forest, girl, soul, idea)
– pronouns (such as it, I, you, which, whoever)
– adjectives (such as beautiful, rare, old)
– participles (adjectives formed from verbs, such as running, as in running water or I see the boy
running down the street)
These four kinds of word are grouped together because, as we will see, they have similar grammatical features. As with verbs, there are two things to look at: what kind of grammatical information
nominal forms express, and how they express it. And again as with verbs, nouns in English and
Sanskrit express the same kind of information, but do so in different ways.
The three grammatical categories that nominal forms express (or, to use the technical term, that
they are marked for) are case, number and gender.
1) CASE
Nominal forms can play various roles in a sentence; case is the name for the way in which a language marks these roles. Look at the following English examples.
The knife lies on the table. – He cuts the cake with a knife.
The city lies on a hill. – She is coming from the city. – She is going to the city.
English frequently marks what role a noun is playing by using a preposition – such as with (used
above for an instrument with which something is done), from (used above for a source or starting-point) or to (e.g. for a goal or aim). For some roles, such as the subject of a sentence (that which
the sentence ‘is about’, so to speak) English does not add any preposition, but marks the case role
by means of word order: in sentences such as ‘The man bites the dog’ and ‘The dog bites the man’
5
44
only the order of the words tells us who is biting (the subject) and whom he bites (the object); the
forms of ‘the man’ and ‘the dog’ remain exactly the same.
In Sanskrit, on the other hand, these various roles are marked through the addition of case endings.
Compare the set of words below:
by the warrior for the warrior of the warrior
क्षत्रियेण kṣatriyeṇa क्षत्रियाय kṣatriyāya क्षत्रियस्य kṣatriyasya
Note how this is parallel to what we saw in verbs: there, too, English typically adds pronouns before the verb (write –› they write), while Sanskrit adds endings onto the verbal stem (√लिख्likh –›
लिखन्तिlikhanti ‘they write’).
Sanskrit has eight cases. Actual endings that these cases are marked by (such as -eṇa, -āya, -asya
above) will not be introduced for another chapter, but what follows is a list of the main usages of
the eight Sanskrit cases. Read it through, memorise the facts given in the Nutshell at the end of the
chapter and use this list for future reference. If the names of the cases are unfamiliar to you: all are
stressed on the first syllable, with the exception of the accúsative and the instruméntal.
a. Nominative: used for the subject of a sentence – what the sentence ‘is about’ – and for anything
referring to that subject.
1) The cat scratches the thief.
2) The dog sleeps.
3) He is the king.
4) She is wise.
5) She became queen.
6) He did this as king.
7) They are seen by the king.
Note that in sentences 3–6, there is not just the subject but there also are words that refer to the
subject. As such, they also stand in the nominative case. (They are said to ‘agree’ with the subject;
see more on ‘agreement’ below.) Sentences 1–6 contain an active verb; in active sentences, the
subject is the ‘doer’ or ‘agent’. In sentences with passive verbs, such as 7, the subject is the ‘done to’
or ‘patient’.
b. Vocative: this case is used to address someone.
1) O king, the guests have arrived.
2) Old man, why do you sit beside the road?
5
45
c. Accusative: usually expresses the direct object of a verb, i.e. that which is affected by the action
of the verb (1, 2). It is also used to express the goal of a motion (3):
1) The cat scratches the thief.
2) The gods grant a favour.
3) The sage goes to the forest.
Sanskrit uses the accusative singular of adjectives (and also nouns) to form adverbs –› Chapter 9
for details. Verbs that take accusative direct objects are called transitive.
d. Instrumental: as the name suggests, this case expresses the instrument with which something
is done. This can be an instrument in the strict sense of the word (1, 2). Together with a verb in
the passive voice (–› Chapter 3), the instrumental is also used to refer to the person by whom
something is done (3). Thirdly, we find the instrumental employed to refer to people together with
whom something is done (4). Note that in English, too, the instrument and the accompanier are
marked in the same way (i.e. by means of the preposition ‘with’).
1) He cuts the cake with a knife.
2) We see with our eyes.
3) The cake was made by her.
4) He went into the forest with his friends.
e. Dative: the dative basically has two uses. It denotes someone to whom the action of the verb
is somehow relevant, who is indirectly involved in this action (1, 2). Over time, this function is
mostly taken over by the genitive (see below). Instead, the dative of purpose makes up much of the
uses of this case: a noun that expresses the purpose of an action stands in the dative; this noun can
be either a thing/an object (3) or another action (4). As a rule of thumb, one can thus expect to
translate a Sanskrit dative into English by means of ‘for’ or ‘to’.
1) I bow to you.
2) They showed it to him.
3) She is striving for peace.
4) I give this to you for safe-keeping.
f. Ablative: this case expresses the source of an action – whether the place from which (1) a movement originates, the time from which (2) something is done, a person from whom something
proceeds (3), or any reason for/because of which (4) something takes place. In short, ablatives
usually have to be translated into English using ‘from’ or ‘out from/out of ’.
1) We came from/out of the city.
2) They had been walking from/since dawn.
3) We heard this from him.
4) He acted out of/from anger.
5
46
g. Genitive: the basic function of the genitive is to give more information about another noun. It
then usually has to be translated as ‘of’.
the house of the king
the children of my friend
a part of the sacrifice
the strength of the enemy
When used with ‘to be’ (as in ‘A is of B’) it expresses the idea of possession:
A son is of him. –› ‘He has a son.’
As mentioned above, the Sanskrit genitive takes over some functions of the dative, and thus is
found to express someone indirectly involved in or concerned with an action: where English would
say ‘she did something good/bad for or to him’, Sanskrit may use a genitive and literally say +
‘she
did something good of him’. As this is ungrammatical in English, this kind of genitive needs to be
translated with ‘for’ or ‘to’, like a dative. Finally, the genitive may be used to express the agent of a
passive verb: +
‘this was done of him’ must be translated as ‘by him’.
h. Locative: as indicated by the name, this is the case used to express a location – or, more generally
put, any place in space or time in, on, at or near which something takes place (1–3). In the dual or
plural, it can express the idea of among (4). It can also express the goal of a motion (then referred
to as ‘pregnant locative’), and in this usage partly overlaps with the accusative (5).
(1) The man is sitting in the forest.
(2) We sacrifice to the gods in the morning/at sunrise.
(3) This happened at the beginning of the story.
(4) He is the greatest among the gods.
(5) She went into the forest.
As stated above in the section on the accusative, verbs that take their direct object in the accusative
are called transitive. A number of Sanskrit verbs, however, can take what would be direct objects in
English (such as ‘you fear me’, ‘he loves her’) in cases other than the accusative: √स्निह्snih ‘to love’,
for example, expresses its object in the locative, while √भी bhī ‘to fear’ takes objects in either the
genitive or ablative. Whenever a verb takes its objects in a case that is perhaps unexpected from
an English point of view, this will be indicated where verbs are introduced (e.g. in a dictionary or
word list).
5

General remarks
Because of its regular use of endings or ‘inflections’ to express concepts such as case, number and
gender in nouns, or person, tense etc. in verbs, Sanskrit is called an inflected language.
The order in which the cases are listed in this book is that traditionally used by Sanskrit grammarians. As you will see when you are introduced to case endings, this order is useful because cases
whose forms are identical stand right next to one another. The vocative is not traditionally included
in that list, which is why some grammars add it right below the nominative, to which it is often
identical, or to the end of the list after the locative. This book does the former.
The main way in which Sanskrit scholars referred to the Sanskrit cases is simply as ‘first’,
‘second’ and so on. The names that Western scholars use describe what a case typically
expresses – the instrumental case marks a noun as an instrument, the locative case marks
it as a ‘location’ or place where, and so on. As these terms are taken from Latin, they
are not always useful to language students nowadays. Yet very briefly: the nominative
literally is the ‘naming case’ (it names the subject, that which the sentence ‘is about’);
the dative literally is the ‘giving case’ (so-called because a typical and frequent dative
usage is found in ‘I give something to you ’); and the ablative literally is the ‘carry-awayfrom case’, i.e. the case indicating the source, or that from which an action originates.
The names for accusative and genitive have a more complicated history and are not very
helpful for understanding what these cases do.
2) NUMBER
The (grammatical) number of a noun expresses how many of something there are. Just like the
verbs, Sanskrit nouns differentiate between singular, dual and plural, denoting one, two and more
than two, respectively. Once again, Sanskrit marks number by the use of endings added to the word
in question. Compare the following:
राजा rājā ‘king’ (Nom Sg)
राजानौ rājānau ‘(exactly) two kings’ (Nom Du)
राजानः rājānaḥ ‘(more than two) kings’ (Nom Pl)
Note that, in the majority of its nouns, English actually does the same to mark number: singulars
such as forest, soul or princess are contrasted with the plurals forests, souls, princesses.
5
48
3) GENDER
Just as ‘number’, when used in grammatical terminology, refers to the number of things as expressed
by the form of a word, so does the term ‘gender’ refer to the grammatical gender of a word. Sanskrit
has three grammatical genders: masculine, feminine and neuter. This is also the case in English. Yet
here gender is visible only in one kind of word, namely in pronouns: because we would refer to any
biologically male being as ‘he’, any female as ‘she’ and any thing or abstract as ‘it’, we say that these
three groups are of masculine, feminine and neuter gender, respectively.
I see the man. He is standing in the street.
I see the woman. She is standing in the street.
I see the car. It is standing in the street.
Apart from this, the main difference between grammatical gender in English and Sanskrit is that
the gender of many Sanskrit words cannot be predicted from their meaning, as it can in English:
Sanskrit words referring to men are usually grammatically masculine and words referring to women
usually grammatically feminine, but there are also words for people that are neuter (such as मित्र- mitra- ‘friend’). Also, things and abstract concepts can have any of the three genders (वृक्ष- vṛkṣa- ‘tree’,
for example, is masculine, नदी- nadī- ‘river’ is feminine and वन- vana- ‘forest’ is neuter).
THREE ASPECTS OF NOMINAL USAGE
a) Agreement
Whenever an adjective, participle or pronoun qualifies a noun, it has to agree with this noun in all
of the three categories nouns are marked for: case, number and gender. For example, while nouns
have one gender inherent to them, adjectives, participles and pronouns have forms for all three
genders and can thus appear in the gender of the noun they are qualifying:
English: a beautiful boy a beautiful girl a beautiful forest
Sanskrit:
शोभनः बालः शोभना कन्या शोभनम् वनम्
śobhanaḥ bālaḥ śobhanā kanyā śobhanam vanam
beautifulMasc boy beautifulFem girl beautifulNtr forest
In these examples, the nominative singular ending -aḥ marks a masculine noun and adjective, -ā a
feminine and -am a neuter. The same principle of agreement also applies to the other grammatical
categories: if the case or number of a noun changes, so must the case and number of the adjective
qualifying that noun.
5
49
c) Articles and Possessive Pronouns
English has two kinds of article: the definite article ‘the’, and the indefinite article ‘a’ or ‘an’. The
definite article is used whenever something known is referred to, the indefinite when no more information is available about something: ‘There’s the cat!’ implies the speaker has seen or mentioned
said cat previously. ‘There’s a cat!’ just points out the existence of an animal that is not further
known or familiar to the speaker.
Sanskrit does not have a regular article; hence we need to decide from the context whether a word
such as नरः naraḥ should be translated as ‘a man’ or ‘the man’. Sometimes, when referring to someone
Nominative singular Genitive singular Genitive plural
शोभनः बालः शोभनस्य बालस्य शोभनानाम् बालानाम्
śobhanaḥ bālaḥ śobhanasya bālasya śobhanānām bālānām
beautifulMasc.Nom.Sg boyNom.Sg beautifulMasc.Gen.Sg boyGen.Sg beautifulMasc.Gen.Pl boyGen.Pl
‘the beautiful boy’ ‘of the beautiful boy’ ‘of the beautiful boys’
b) Stems/Declensions
A nominal form without any case ending is called a stem. There are several sets of endings used
to make the noun forms described above. Which set of endings is added to a given noun stem is
determined by the final sound of that stem: if a noun stem ends in e.g. -a, it is called an a-stem, and
a-stem endings are added to it. If it ends in an -s, it is called an s-stem, and consonant-stem endings
are added to it (the same endings that would also be added to a noun stem that ends in any other
consonant). Pronouns have yet other endings to express these same concepts. Whenever a noun
stem is listed without any case ending, this is indicated by means of a hyphen, as in वृक्ष- vṛkṣa- ‘tree’
(as opposed to e.g. वृक्षः vṛkṣaḥ, the nominative singular form).
Sanskrit thus has different ways of expressing the same information; and therefore, forms that agree
grammatically do not need to have identical-looking endings: for example, the feminine ī-stem
noun नारी- nārī- ‘woman’ has a nominative singular नारी nārī; when it stands together with the pronoun स- ‘this’ and the adjective शोभन- śobhana- ‘beautiful’, these need to appear in their feminine
form, and we thus get Nom Sg सा शोभना नारी sā śobhanā nārī, Gen Sg तस्याः शोभनायाः नार्याः tasyāḥ
śobhanāyāḥ nāryāḥ, Gen Pl तासां शोभनानां नारीणाम्tāsāṃ śobhanānāṃ nārīṇām etc.
The various declensions are introduced over the course of the book: a-stems (Chapter 6), āstems (Chapter 9), ī- and ū-stems (Chapter 13), dental and palatal stems (Chapter 15), s-stems
(Chapter 24), vant-/mant- and ant-stems (Chapter 25), i- and u-stems (Chapter 26), ṛstems and n-stems (Chapter 29), stems in -(ī)yas- and -vas- (Chapter 35). Then there are
3rd-person pronouns (Chapters 20, 22, 39) and 1st- and 2nd-person pronouns (Chapter 32).
5
50
or something mentioned earlier in a narrative, Sanskrit may use the pronoun स sa ‘he, this one’, as in
स नरः sa naraḥ, to express ‘this (man), the same one as before’. (–› Chapter 20 for more details on स sa.)
Also, while English usually employs possessive pronouns in expressions such as ‘a girl and her mother’ or ‘a boy and his friends’ or ‘our house is beautiful’, Sanskrit does not. Rather, it would literally say
‘girl and mother’ or ‘boy and friends’ or ‘house is beautiful’; the reader or listener then needs to infer
from the context that the mother mentioned is likely to be the girl’s own mother, and so on.
‘POSTPOSITIONS’
English typically uses prepositions to express what case a noun stands in (of the man, for the child etc.),
while Sanskrit employs case endings to do that. Yet Sanskrit also has a small number of postpositions
that express or support case function. (Prepositions get their name from the fact that they are put pre-
(i.e. before) the noun; postpositions are put post (i.e. after) it.) The three of these in most frequent use
are सह saha ‘together with’ (+ a noun in the instrumental), विना vinā ‘without’ (+ a noun in the instrumental, accusative or ablative) and प्रति prati: ‘towards; concerning, about’ (+ a noun in the accusative).
मित्रैः सह गृहं प्रति गच्छति

‘He goes towards the/his house with his friends.’
THE NUTSHELL: NOMINAL FORMS
Nominals include: nouns/substantives, pronouns, adjectives, participles.
Case Number Gender
Nominative (Nom): subject
Vocative (Voc): o…!
Accusative (Acc): dir. object, goal
Instrumental (Instr): with, by
Dative (Dat): for/to
Ablative (Abl): (out) of, from
Genitive (Gen): of; for/to
Locative (Loc): in, on, at; into
Singular (Sg)
Dual (Du)
Plural (Pl)
Masculine (Masc/m.)
Feminine (Fem/f.)
Neuter (Ntr/n.)
Note:
– Substantives have one ‘inherent’ gender. Pronouns, adjectives and participles have different
forms for each gender.
– ‘Number’ and ‘gender’ are grammatical terms. Grammatical gender and biological sex often
do not overlap.

which case do they stand in?
The Alarming Spread of Poetry
To the thinking man there are few things more disturbing than the realisation that we
are becoming a nation of minor poets. In the good old days poets were for the most
part confined to garrets, which they left only for the purpose of being ejected from the
offices of magazines and papers to which they attempted to sell their wares. Nobody
ever thought of reading a book of poems unless accompanied by a guarantee from the
publisher that the author had been dead at least a hundred years. Poetry, like wine,
certain brands of cheese, and public buildings, was rightly considered to improve with
age; and no connoisseur could have dreamed of filling himself with raw, indigestible
verse, warm from the maker.
Today, however, editors are paying real money for poetry; publishers are making a
profit on books of verse; and many a young man who, had he been born earlier, would
have sustained life on a crust of bread, is now sending for the manager to find out how
5
53
the restaurant dares try to sell a fellow champagne like this as genuine Pommery Brut.
Naturally this is having a marked effect on the life of the community. Our children grow
to adolescence with the feeling that they can become poets instead of working. Many
an embryo bill clerk has been ruined by the heady knowledge that poems are paid for
at the rate of a dollar a line. All over the country promising young plasterers and rising
young motormen are throwing up steady jobs in order to devote themselves to the
new profession. On a sunny afternoon down in Washington Square one’s progress is
positively impeded by the swarms of young poets brought out by the warm weather. It
is a horrible sight to see those unfortunate youths, who ought to be sitting happily at
desks writing ‘Dear Sir, Your favour of the tenth inst. duly received and contents noted.
In reply we beg to state …’ wandering about with their fingers in their hair and their
features distorted with the agony of composition, as they try to find rhymes to ‘cosmic’
and ‘symbolism’.
(P. G. Wodehouse)
The Jabberwocky
’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.
‘Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
The frumious Bandersnatch!’
He took his vorpal sword in hand:
Long time the manxome foe he sought –
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
And stood awhile in thought.
And as in uffish thought he stood,
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
And burbled as it came!
5
54
One, two! One, two! and through and through
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
He went galumphing back.
‘And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!’
He chortled in his joy.
’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.
(Lewis Carroll)

READING
Read and use the grammatical descriptions given in subscript to help you understand the structure
of the text. Compare the Sanskrit cases with their English translations, and look at the agreement
between nouns and participles or adjectives.

‘From/because of Hanumān’s advice (Abl), having met (Nom) wit h Sugrīva (Instr), greatstrengthed Rāma (Nom) said to Sugrīva (Dat) all this (Acc). And by the king of the monkeys
(Instr), all (Nom) concerning t he feud-st ory (Acc) [was] made known (Nom) t o Rāma (Dat).’
(More idiomatic: ‘Following Hanumān’s advice, strong Rāma met with Sugrīva and told him all
this. And the king of the monkeys revealed to Rāma the entire story of this feud.’) (Based on
Rāmāyaṇa 1.47–9.)
Note: It is because the participle समागतः ‘having come together (with)’ stands in the masculine
nominative singular that we know that it agrees with रामः, which is grammatically masculine and
also stands in the nominative singular. The same applies to वैर-अनुकथनम्vaira-anukathanam,
आवेदितम्āveditam and सर्वम्sarvam – all are in the accusative singular, and the latter two appear
in their neuter form because they agree with the noun वैर-अनुकथनम्vaira-anukathanam ‘feud-report, report of the feud’, which is intrinsically neuter.

CHAPTER 6
a-Stems
A-STEM NOUNS
All noun stems ending in the same sound share a set of endings. This chapter introduces stems
ending in -a, also called a-stems. These form the largest group of nouns in Sanskrit. They are
always either masculine or neuter. The list of all case forms of a given noun is called the paradigm.
Below is the paradigm of the a-stem noun देव- deva- (m.) ‘god’. (Larger fields containing just one
form indicate that this one form is used for more than one case.)
Masc. a-stem noun: देव- ‘god’
Singular Dual Plural
Nominative (Nom) देवः devaḥ
देवौ devau
देवाः devāḥ
Vocative (Voc) देव deva
Accusative (Acc) देवम्devam देवान्devān
Instrumental (Instr) देवेन devena
देवाभ्याम्devābhyām
देवैः devaiḥ
Dative (Dat) देवाय devāya देवेभ्यः devebhyaḥ Ablative (Abl) देवात्devāt
Genitive (Gen) देवस्य devasya देवयोः devayoḥ
देवानाम्devānām
Locative (Loc) देवेdeve देवेषुdeveṣu
Most of these endings are also used by a-stem nouns that are of neuter gender, such as वन- vana-
(n.) ‘forest’. Neuter nouns always have identical forms for nominative and accusative (and often
also the vocative) within each number. The only cases in which they are formally different from
masculine nouns of the same declension are nominative, vocative and accusative. In the case of astems, the Acc Sg Ntr is identical to its masculine counterpart.
6

Singular Dual Plural
Nom वनम्vanam
Voc वन vana वनेvane वनानि vanāni
Acc वनम्vanam
Instr वनेन vanena वनाभ्याम् vanābhyām वनैः vanaiḥ
etc. etc. etc.
Ntr. a-stem noun: वन- ‘forest’
Memorise these forms. Recite the paradigm aloud. You may also find it useful to write each form
on its own flash card or use the electronic flash cards available via the Cambridge Introduction to
Sanskrit website at www.cambridge-sanskrit.org.
A-STEM ADJECTIVES
The above are a-stem nouns. There also are a-stem adjectives. As was mentioned in the Road Map in
Chapter 5, adjectives have different forms for each of the three genders. Masculine a-stem adjectives
have the same endings as masculine a-stem nouns, and neuter a-stem adjectives the same as neuter
a-stem nouns. Thus, the Nom Sg forms of an adjective such as प्रिय- priya- ‘dear’ are masculine प्रियः
priyaḥ and neuter प्रियम्priyam. The feminines of most a-stem adjectives follow the paradigm of āstems (read ‘long-ā-stems’), but some have ī-stem (‘long-ī-stem’) forms. As those stems will not be
introduced until Chapters 9 and 13, respectively, only the masculine and neuter forms of adjectives
will be used for now.
–› Chapter 9 for more on adjective formation.
DICTIONARY MATTERS
While some dictionaries will list nouns by their actual nominative form (such as ‘नरः naraḥ “man”’),
others provide the stem and gender for nouns (‘नर- nara- (m.) “man’’’). It is customary to give just
the stem for adjectives (‘प्रिय- priya-“dear”’); their forms/endings can be predicted from their stem.
Yet in those cases where an a-stem adjective has an ī-stem feminine, this information is given
specifically (such as ‘सुन्दर- sundara- f. -ī “beautiful”’, or as सुन्दर- sundara-, f. सुन्दरी- sundarī-, with
the f. standing for ‘feminine’).
6
59
RETROFLEXION OF N
We should look at one more formal phenomenon that affects the case endings just introduced. In
some nouns, the endings that include an -n- (Instr Sg -ena, NomVocAcc Pl Ntr -āni and Gen Pl
-ānām) appear as -eṇa, -āṇi and -āṇām, respectively, including a retroflex -ṇ- instead of its dental
counterpart -n-. The rule behind this is as follows:
n turns into ṇ
after r, ṛ, ṝ and ṣ anywhere within the same word,
unless the n is followed by a stop
or stands at the end of the word
or unless a dental, palatal or retroflex stop, or s or ś, stands anywhere between the two.
Thus, in contrast to e.g. Instr Sg वनेन vanena, Gen Pl वनानाम्vanānām and NomVocAcc Pl वनानि
vanāni (from वन- vana- (n.) ‘forest’), we find Instr Sg मित्रेण mitreṇa, Gen Pl मित्राणाम्mitrāṇām
and NomVocAcc Pl मित्राणि mitrāṇi (from मित्र- mitra- (n.) ‘friend’).
The following is happening here: r, ṛ, ṝ and ṣ are all sounds that leave the tongue in a
more or less retroflex (i.e. ‘curled back’) position. Unless a sound intervenes that forces
the tongue into a different position, an -n- in the same word then also becomes retroflex.
Sounds forcing the tongue into a new position include dental and palatal sounds (for
which the tongue needs to be in a different position to start with), or retroflex stops
(having pronounced which, the tongue uncurls). Also, if the -n- stands before a stop,
such as -t-, this stop prevents the -n- from changing.
–› Pp. 390–2 in the Appendices for a more comprehensive account of these and other
phenomena known as ‘internal sandhi ’.
SYNTACTIC NOTE: इति ITI AND DIRECT SPEECH
इति iti is a particle roughly equivalent to closing quotation marks. It is used to mark a preceding
clause as a quotation/thought or an indirect statement: स सुखः इति वदति sa sukhaḥ iti vadati ‘“He
[is] happy”, he says’ or ‘He says that he is happy.’ (√वद्vad I ‘to say, speak’.) It is also used with single
words: क्षत्रियः अर्जुनः इति kṣatriyaḥ arjunaḥ iti ‘a warrior called “Arjuna”’.
The end of a quotation (etc.) is thus marked by इति iti. Sometimes, a question word (such as किम्
kim or अपि api –› Chapter 3) or a vocative indicate the beginning of a quotation. Yet often there is
6
no visible marker to announce the beginning of a quotation. In a sentence such as जनाः गृहं विशति
इति वदन्ति janāḥ gṛhaṃ viśati iti vadanti ‘The people say, “He is entering the house”’, we thus need
to look at the syntax of the sentence to determine where the quotation, concluded by इति iti, starts.
Practical Note: Memorising Nouns
It is customary to list Sanskrit nouns by their stems: if you know a noun’s stem and gender, you
know how to form all its cases. Yet sometimes it is easier to remember nouns by their Nom Sg
forms: rather than memorising a-stems as e.g. नर nara- (m.) ‘man’ and मित्र- mitra- (n.) ‘friend’,
you may find it easier to remember them as नरः naraḥ and मित्रम्mitram. If you find it confusing to memorise a-stems by their nominatives and all other nouns by their stems, stick to just
stems; yet if the नरः naraḥ/मित्रम्mitram approach works for you, use it.

4) Translate into English.
Note: In sentences of the type ‘A is B’, Sanskrit often does not use a form of ‘to be’. In the English
translation, a form of this verb may thus need to be inserted. For example: +
House big. –› The
house is big. Also, Sanskrit prose typically puts genitives in front of nouns they depend on (as
in the English ‘the master’s (genitive) voice (main/“head” noun)’); verbs tend to appear last in
a sentence. (See below for a more detailed account of this.)

READINGS
From this chapter on, the section ‘Readings’ will present excerpts from actual Sanskrit texts. Read them
out loud and translate them into English. If you find this difficult, do not worry: that is normal. These
texts were intended for audiences fluent in Sanskrit. Pay close attention to the grammar notes on the side
and the vocabulary list given underneath each passage, and translating them will soon become easier.
There are several things that will be helpful to take into account.
Sanskrit Word Order
In Sanskrit prose, we tend to find the subject at or near the beginning of the clause, the verb at the
end and the remainder of the sentence between them. Adjectives stand in front of the nouns that
they agree with (such as पापः क्षत्रियः pāpaḥ kṣatriyaḥ ‘the evil warrior’); so do genitive attributes
(नृपस्य दूतः nṛpasya dūtaḥ ‘the king’s messenger’). Yet there is quite some flexibility, and the more
important a word seems to an author, the closer to the beginning of the sentence it may stand. This
prose word order is used in the Exercise Sentences of each chapter. Yet most of the Readings are
not in prose but in śloka metre, in which word order is extremely varied. This means that each part
of a sentence (the subject, the verb and so on) may stand in a number of positions – early on in a
sentence, later in a sentence, and possibly quite far away from words that it is closely linked to, as
e.g. an adjective that describes a noun. Therefore we must pay close attention to verbal and case
९) नृपाय जनाः बालाः इव प्रियाः ।
१०) अपि बालस्य मित्राणि शूराणि पापानि वा ।
११) अश्वः नरं बालौ च वनात् नगरं प्रति भरति ।
१२) शूराः नराः अपि सिहौ वने पश्यथ ं ।
१३) बालः मित्रस्य वचनानि न स्मरति ।
१४) अश्वाः युद्धात् हृष्यन्ति इति शूरः बोधति ।
२५) अपि नरः अश्वः च व्याघ्रान् पश्यतः ।
१६) ईश्वराः पापानां नराणाम् अश्वान् हर न्त गृहान् च लुम्प न्त ।
१७) वृक् एव फला षे नि पश्यामि ।
१८) इह युद्धे पापान् शूरान् च जनान् पश्यामि ।

64
 endings that tell us which function each word has in a sentence (the subject always stands in the
nominative, an adjective that describes a noun will stand in the same case, number and gender
as that noun etc.). If you do not understand a sentence, look specifically for the verb, which will
probably tell you what the nouns in the sentence may be doing: if the verb is something like to give,
you will want to know who gives what and to whom. If it is something like to say or to talk, ask e.g.
to whom? about what? If to go, ask where to? from where? with whom? etc.
Punctuation
Sanskrit has almost no regular punctuation marks. Especially in metrical texts, where the signs ।
and ॥  are used to indicate the end of a metrical line or unit (rather than a sentence), it is up to us to
see how long a sentence goes on, where it ends and where a new one starts. Some modern Sanskrit
texts put in punctuation marks; wherever necessary, this book will remark on unexpected sentence
breaks (‘a new sentence begins at…’) or sense breaks (‘imagine a colon/dash/comma etc. at…’) in
the Notes to each passage.
Two Points on the Verb ‘to be’
As was mentioned above, in sentences of the type ‘A is B’, Sanskrit often does not use a form of the
verb ‘to be’: instead of ‘the house is big’, Sanskrit might say ‘house big’. In translations into English, a
form of ‘to be’ thus often needs to be supplied. Secondly, as mentioned in the section on case usage
in Chapter 5, when the genitive is used together with a form of ‘to be’ (e.g. to literally say ‘of him is
a son’), it expresses possession: ‘he has a son’.
Compounds
Sanskrit very frequently uses compound nouns, i.e. nouns consisting of two or more nominal
stems put together (such as we also find in English black-board or tooth-paste). Translate them by
identifying and translating the words they consist of and putting these together. In e.g. the second
reading passage in this chapter, the word गोप्रदान- gopradāna- consists of the words गो- go- ‘cow,
cattle’ and प्रदान- pradāna- ‘gift’, each of which is listed in the vocabulary. Together, they literally are
a ‘cattle-gift’ – i.e. ‘a gift (consisting) of cattle’.
Compounds will be systematically introduced in Chapter 14.
Translation: A General Observation
A point that applies to translating from any one language into another: you may have noticed that
several words introduced so far were given more than one English translation. प्रति prati, for example, was translated both as ‘towards’ and as ‘concerning’; √भृbhṛ is both ‘to carry’ and ‘to bear’;
फल- phala- is both ‘a fruit’ and ‘a reward’. The reason for this is that most words in one language
correspond to the usages of more than one word in another language. प्रति prati is used both to
6
65
express the direction of a motion (e.g. going towards the forest) or the ‘direction’ or topic of a conversation (e.g. to talk about something). Sanskrit uses one verb, √भृbhṛ, where English uses two
to distinguish between carrying a load (where the act of carrying is neutral) and bearing a burden
(a negative (and figurative) use of the idea of carrying something). फल- phala- is employed both
for the fruits of a tree and the fruits of an action, and while English ‘fruit’ has the same range of
meaning, we may sometimes want to be less poetic and talk about the reward or result of an action.
This lack of a one-to-one correspondence between words is a regular occurrence across languages;
in artful, literary language this may be even more noticeable. Furthermore, given that the literature composed in Sanskrit spans far more than a millennium, a time during which words may
change their usage, the range of meanings associated with one Sanskrit word may be considerable.
(‘Extreme’ examples of this will be introduced explicitly in the notes on पर- para- ‘far’ (Chapter 22)
and √युज्yuj ‘to link’ (Chapter 30).) Thus, whenever you are reading a text in another language and
are unsure how to translate a specific word, use the context to help you find the right translation.
Think about e.g. the action of completing or finishing something: you do your homework, you
make your bed, you set a table, you prepare a meal. You talk to someone, but you say something to
someone. You talk about one person, but about several people; and so on.
In short: be prepared to find slightly different words with similar meanings (but other usages)
whenever the translation you have memorised does not result in an idiomatic translation. This is
the main challenge in translating well. It will become easier the more you translate.
In the vocabulary beneath each passage:
– Words are listed according to the traditional order of Sanskrit characters introduced in
Chapters 1 and 2.
– Nouns are marked by reference to their gender (m./f./n.).
– Verbs are marked by reference to their class (I–X).
– Participles and other adjectives are marked as (Adj).
– Pronouns are marked as (Pron), pronominal adjectives are marked as (Pron Adj) –
treat them as you would treat adjectives until their introduction in Chapters 20 and 22,
respectively.
– Adverbs and other indeclinable words, which have one form only, are marked as (Indc);
numerals (i.e. words for numbers) are marked as (Num).
– As is customary, words that appear in a certain form only at the end of a compound (Latin
in fine compositi; –› Chapter 14 on compounds), are marked as (ifc).
– Wherever this is possibly helpful for understanding a compound listed in the vocabulary
underneath a reading passage, members of the compound will be separated by hyphens.

CHAPTER 7
Vowel Gradation and Why We Need to Know about It
This chapter explains the systematics of the phenomenon of vowel gradation of which we
caught our first glimpse in Chapter 3. It is meant to help us understand what has been
introduced so far and complete our understanding of it by adding a number of details. It
makes frequent reference to Chapter 2, particularly the sections on complex vowels and
semivowels/glides. You may find it useful to look at those again.
VOWEL GRADATION
In Chapter 4, we saw that Class I verbs are formed in the following way:
Class I: The vowel -a- is added into the root before the root vowel; then -a- is added after
the root.
Examples: √भृbhṛ ‘to carry’, root vowel: -ṛ-; present stem भर- bhara-
√बुध्budh ‘to awake’, root vowel -u-; present stem बोध- bodhaThe step of adding an -a- before another vowel (in the cases above: before ṛ and u) is part of a
larger system that is known as vowel gradation (or also ablaut). It appears across Sanskrit verbs and
nouns, and works as follows.
In Sanskrit, the simple vowels have three ‘grades’: basic or zero grade, full grade (or to use Sanskrit
terminology, guṇa, literally meaning ‘characteristic’ or ‘quality’) and lengthened grade (or vṛddhi,
meaning ‘growth’). The zero grade consists of just the vowel itself; in guṇa, an -a- is added to it;
in vṛddhi, a long -ā- is added to it.
One good place for looking at this system is in the context of verbal roots. In the different forms of
the verb, all three grades of the vowel in its root (and thus, as we say, all three grades of the root)
can be found. For example, the verbal root meaning ‘to carry’ is √भृbhṛ. The vowel contained in it
is ṛ. In guṇa, there is an -a- added, giving us भर्bhar (which we know from the present-tense stem
in e.g. the 3rd Sg भरति bharati); in vṛddhi, a long -ā- is added, giving भार् -bhār- (which we will find
e.g. in the perfect tense –› Chapter 28).

The following table gives an overview of all grades of all vowels:

ṛ/ṝ ar ār
ḷ al āl
i/ī ay/e āy/ai
u/ū av/o āv/au
- a ā
ṛ/ṝ and ḷ
After the vowel -a- added in guṇa, the zero-grade vowels ṛ/ṝ and ḷ always turn into their consonantal
counterpart, as e.g. a + ṝ –› ar. (–› Chapter 2 on Semivowels/Glides.)
i/ī and u/ū
The zero-grade vowels i/ī and u/ū turn into glides and appear in guṇa as ay/av and in vṛddhi as
āy/āv when they are followed by a vowel. (–› Chapter 2 on semivowels/glides.) Before consonants,
i/ī and u/ū appear in guṇa as e and o, and in vṛddhi as ai and au, respectively. The following is
happening here: originally, what now appears as e was *ai; what now appears as ai once was *āi.
(–› Chapter 2; the asterisk * is used to indicate a form that is not actually attested, but that we know
existed at some earlier stage in the language.) In front of another vowel, the i in this original *ai and *āi
turns into a -y-, and we thus do not have diphthongs ai and āi any more, but ay and āy instead (e.g. *ai +
a –› aya). Yet whenever a consonant follows, the diphthongs ai and āi are maintained, and at some
point in the history of Sanskrit all instances of ai turned into e and all instances of āi turned into
ai. As a result, we get the odd-looking pairs of prevocalic ay/preconsonantal e, and prevocalic āy/
preconsonantal ai.
7
70
The same applies to u: in original guṇa *au and vṛddhi *āu, u turns into a v whenever it is followed
by a vowel, giving us av and āv, respectively; yet before consonants, *au and *āu turn into o and
au, respectively.
If you find this explanation helpful, remember it. If not, simply memorise the patterns of
zero-grade i/ī – guṇa ay or e – vṛddhi āy or ai and u/ū – av or o – āv or au. They will reoccur
frequently.
a
Note that although a counts as a ‘simple’ vowel, it does not appear among the other simple vowels in
the left-hand column of the table. This is because the zero grade of verbal roots is characterised by
an absence of -a-, which is only added in guṇa and vṛddhi. (The zero grade has zero -a-, so to speak.)
Difference in Vowel Grade vs. Difference in Meaning
As was stated just above, different forms of the verb are associated with different grades
of the root vowel. Yet in themselves, the different grades of a vowel do not carry any
difference in meaning. There once were factors in the language (specifically, accents
and their movement) that caused this difference in root grades mentioned above. These
determined that, for example, the zero grade of the root vowel is found in the past
participle (Chapter 8), or that some nouns have ‘strong’ and ‘weak’ stems (e.g. Chapter 25).
Something similar may be observed in English: verbs such as leave, weep, lead etc. have
a long vowel in their present tense form and a short vowel in their past tense form (left,
wept, led). Here, too, these short-vowel forms are associated with the past tense, yet there
is nothing inherently ‘past’ in any short vowel as such.
APPLICATIONS
Knowledge of vowel gradation helps us understand how the sanskrit verbal system works.
It is up to you to what extent you wish to simply memorise the facts introduced below,
or to try to understand the system underlying them. This applies especially to sections
c) and d). Just as a student of English may memorise the forms sing, sang, sung without
questioning the system behind them, so the student of Sanskrit may just memorise that
the present tense of √नी nī ‘to lead’ (Class I) is नयति nayati, or that √पत  ्pat ‘to fall, to fly’
(also Class I) is पतति patati (without the addition of an a into the root to form the stem,
as one might expect). Yet, as there is a system behind all these things, this system will be
explained here for anyone who finds it useful.
7
71
a) Verb Classes
The different verb classes are distinguished from one another not just by what is added after the
verbal root, but also by what grade the root stands in. To systematise what was introduced in
Chapter 4:
  Class I Present Stem: The root stands in guṇa; -a- is added after it. √भृbhṛ ‘to carry’ –›
भर- bharaClass IV Present Stem: The root stands in zero grade; -ya- is added after it. √हृष्hṛṣ ‘to
rejoice’ –› हृष्य- hṛṣyaClass VI Present Stem: The root stands in zero grade; -a- is added after it. √विश्viś ‘to enter’ –› विश- viśab) Class X Presents
Understanding vowel gradation also allows us to introduce Class X present stems:
 Class X: The root stands in zero grade, guṇa or vṛddhi; -aya- is added after it.
Examples: √चिन्त्cint ‘to worry’ –› चिन्तय- cintaya- –› चिन्तयति cintayati ‘he worries’
√कथ्kath ‘to tell’ –› कथय- kathaya- –› कथयति kathayati ‘he tells’
√चुर्cur ‘to steal’ –› चोरय- coraya- –› चोरयति corayati ‘he steals’
√क्षल्kṣal ‘to wash’ –› क्षालय- kṣālaya- –› क्षालयति kṣālayati ‘he washes’
The choice of stem-vowel grade in Class X stems usually depends on whatever creates a
long/heavy syllable: roots that in their zero grade contain i or u followed by a consonant
only need to go as far as guṇa to contain a long vowel (e or o, respectively), while verbs
whose roots end in a vowel (see c) below), or which follow the pattern zero – a – ā
contain a long vowel only in vṛddhi.
Many verbs that have Class X present tense forms are ‘denominal’ verbs, meaning they
are based on nouns. Nouns such as कथा kathā ‘story’ or चिन्ता cintā ‘worry, thought’ (–›
Chapter 9) are taken, often without their final vowel, and the suffix -aya- and personal
endings are added to them. In denominal verbs, thus, the ‘grade’ in which the stem
appears is simply the form of the basic noun; –› √कथ्kath –› कथयति kathayati ‘he tells,
talks about’ or √चिन्त्cint –› चिन्तयति cintayati ‘he worries; he thinks’.
c) Causatives
The two steps to create a Class X present stem (strengthening the verbal root to contain a heavy
syllable and adding -aya-) can also be applied to verbs from other classes. This process then creates
7
72
causative verbs. Causatives denote not just ‘doing x’ but ‘causing (someone) to do x’, ‘making/
having (someone) do x’. For example:
√विश्viś ‘to enter’ –› वेशयति veśayati ‘he causes (someone) to enter’
√दृश्dṛś ‘to see’ –› दर्शयति darśayati ‘he makes (someone) see’, thus ‘he shows’
√भृbhṛ ‘to carry’ –› भारयति bhārayati ‘he makes (someone) carry’
Roots that end in -ā form their causative by inserting -p- before the -aya-:
√स्था sthā ‘to stand’ –› स्थापयति sthāpayati ‘he causes (someone) to stand, positions
(someone)’
Note that in the causative, the formal changes that the verbal stem undergoes are linked to a change
in meaning. This process is thus different from the formation of present stems of the different verb
classes, where the formal changes (such as adding -a- or -ya-) do not affect the meaning of the verb.
Causatives and Class X verbs overlap in their origins, and no causatives are formed of
Class X verbs; if necessary, a verb with a similar meaning can be taken, and a causative of
that formed.
d) Verbal Roots Ending in a Vowel
Roots containing i/ī or u/ū followed by a consonant display guṇa e or o, as in e.g. √शुच्śuc –› शोचति
śocati. Yet the guṇa of roots that end in i/ī or u/ū does not contain such an e or o: √नी nī ‘to lead’,
√द्रुdru ‘to run’ and √भूbhū ‘to be’ are all Class I; their present tense forms are नयति nayati, द्रवति
dravati and भवति bhavati. The following has happened here: we know that the guṇa e goes back to
an original ai. Yet the development from ai to e actually took place only if a consonant followed. If a
vowel follows, i/ī and u/ū behave exactly like ṛ/ṝ and ḷ: they turn into their respective glides, namely
-y- and -v-, resulting in the guṇa forms -ay- and -av- and thus verbal forms such as नयति nayati,
द्रवति dravati, and so on. (To put this more systematically: original *ai/*au change into e/o before
a consonant, but into ay/av in front of another vowel. Original *āi/*āu change into ai/au before a
consonant, but into āy/āv in front of another vowel.)
e) Verbal Roots Cited in Guṇa
Verbal roots are usually cited in their most basic form, i.e. zero grade, whenever they are discussed
or listed in a dictionary or other kind of vocabulary list. (Look at the vocabulary at the end of
7
73
Chapter 4 for some examples.) From this basic form, all other forms of the root can be inferred:
adding -a- before the root vowel results in guṇa, adding -ā- in that same place results in vṛddhi. Yet
there are a number of roots that do not follow this pattern.
Some verbs add a/ā not before, but after the zero-grade vowel. For example, in its zero grade, the
root of one of the Sanskrit verbs meaning ‘to speak, to say’ is √उद्ud. This verb is Class I, hence we
would expect its present tense stem to be +
ओद- oda- (with a added before zero-grade u, and with
original +
auda changing into +
oda). Yet its actual present tense stem is वद- vada-: the guṇa -a- is
added not before, but after the zero-grade vowel -u-, which accordingly changes into -v- before the
vowel that now follows.
Just from looking at a zero-grade root, we cannot infer whether it will add guṇa -a- (and vṛddhi -ā-)
before or after its zero-grade vowel. Roots that do not follow the regular pattern (guṇa or vṛddhi
vowel added before the root vowel) are thus conventionally listed in guṇa: from guṇa vad, one can
arrive at both the zero grade (ud) and vṛddhi (vād) forms of this root. Thus it is always listed as
√vad, never as +
√ud. To give more examples:
√वच्vac ‘to speak’: zero grade उच्uc, vṛddhi वाच्vāc
√स्वप्svap ‘to sleep’: zero grade सुप्sup, vṛddhi स्वाप्svāp
√यज् yaj ‘to offer, sacrifice’: zero grade इज्ij, vṛddhi याज्yāj
√रक्ष्rakṣ ‘to protect’: zero grade ऋक्ष्ṛkṣ, vṛddhi राक्ष्rākṣ
Remember that in the zero grade of such verbs, what appears as y- and v- before vowels turns into
i- and u-, respectively, in front of a consonant. This may make the zero-grade forms difficult to
recognise.
Roots ending in a nasal are also always cited in guṇa rather than in zero grade. The zero-grade
forms of e.g. √गम्gam ‘to go’ or √मन्man ‘to think’ are gm and mn; yet they rarely ever appear as
that. A consonant follows in almost all instances in which the zero-grade root is used, and between
consonants nasals change into -a-. Thus, the zero-grade roots usually appear as ga and ma. Yet on
the basis of the zero grades ga and ma, we are not able to infer the actual correct guṇa and vṛddhi,
gam/man and gām/mān. Thus such roots are also cited in guṇa.
Zero-grade forms of the type ga or ma complicate our table of vowel grades as they create roots
with the pattern zero grade -a-, guṇa -a-, vṛddhi -ā-. If you prefer, remember this pattern (which is
7
74
Remember that nasals between consonants change into -a-.
This is a process you will encounter in Sanskrit with some frequency.
Zero grade Full grade Lengthened grade
gm
infrequent: when vowel follows
gam gām
ga
frequent: when consonant follows
gam gām
what you actually see in most verb forms) rather than the system of zero – a – ā (which represents
the underlying system). The following table gives an overview of the different grades of √गम्gam.
The last group of roots to be listed in guṇa are those whose zero grade is never actually used in any
verb form (such as √पत  ्pat ‘to fall, fly’).
Briefly put, whenever the zero grade does not allow us to infer the forms of guṇa and vṛddhi, a
verbal root will be cited in guṇa. Thus, if a root is listed in a form that contains an -a-, you know
that it stands in full grade and that the -a- needs to be removed to get to the zero grade. If a root
is listed containing any other vowel (i/ī, u/ū, ṛ/ṝ, ḷ), you know that -a- and -ā- need to be added in
front of that vowel to form guṇa and vṛddhi.
THE NUTSHELL: VOWEL GRADATION
– There are three vowel grades: basic/zero, full (guṇa) and lengthened (vṛddhi).
The zero grade includes just the vowel itself.
Guṇa adds an -a-.
Vṛddhi adds an -ā-.
– A verbal root whose vowel is in zero grade is said to stand in zero grade itself, etc.
– Standardly, verbal roots are listed in their zero-grade form. If their other grades cannot
be inferred from the zero grade, or the zero grade is never actually used, the full-grade
form is listed (–› √वच्vac, √यज्yaj, √गम्gam, √पत्pat).
Class X verbs
Formation: verbal root in zero grade guṇa or
vṛddhi, add -aya-.
Example: √चुर्cur ‘to steal’ –› चोरयति corayati
‘he steals’.
Just another verb class.
Causatives
Formation: verbal root in guṇa or vṛddhi,
add -aya-.
Example: √भृbhṛ –› भारयति bhārayati
‘he causes to carry’.
Not another verb class, but a secondary formation that effects a change in meaning.

CHAPTER 8
Absolutives, ta-Participles and Infinitives; Introduction
to Internal Sandhi
There is a crucial difference between how Sanskrit and English use verbs. In a sentence that describes more than one action, English typically uses a chain of finite verbs:
She leaves the house, goes into the forest and sits down.
After she left the house and went into the forest, she sat down.
Sanskrit, on the other hand, frequently has no more than one finite verb in a sentence. Other verbs
appear in non-finite form, either as absolutives (also sometimes called gerunds) or as participles.
Literally translated, Sanskrit would say:
Having left(absolutive/participle) the house and having gone(absolutive/participle) into the forest,
she sat(finite verb) down.
This section will introduce you to the most frequent of these non-finite forms, the absolutive and
the ta-participle.
FORMATION AND MEANING OF THE ABSOLUTIVE AND THE TA-PARTICIPLE
Both of these are formed by adding a suffix to the zero-grade root of a verb. The suffix added in the
case of the absolutive of simple verbs is -tvā, that of the ta-participle is -ta-.
The absolutive of a verb ‘x’ means ‘having x-ed’. For example:
√द् ‘to run’ –›
रु द्रुत्वा ‘having run’
√कृ ‘to do’ –› कृत्वा ‘having done’
√गम् ‘to go’ –› गत्वा ‘having gone’ (on the zero grade of √गम् –› Chapter 7)
8
81
(Absolutives of compound verbs, i.e. verbs that have a preverb (to be introduced
in Chapter 10), add -tya if they end in a short vowel, and -ya otherwise. For
example, अप-√द्रु‘to run away’ (अप- = ‘away’) –› अपद्त्यरु ‘having run away’; प्रति-
√लिख् ‘to write back’ (प्रति- = ‘back’) –› प्रतिलिख्य ‘having written back’.)
The ta-participle of a verb ‘x’ has a past passive meaning ‘having been x-ed’. For example:
√भृ ‘to carry’ –› भृत- ‘having been carried’
√कृ ‘to do’ –› कृत- ‘having been done’
If a verb cannot sensibly form a passive, the ta-participle has active meaning:
√भू ‘to become/be’ –› भूत- ‘having become’
√गम् ‘to go’ –› गत- ‘having gone’
(Note how a passive expression such as +
‘having been become’ would not make sense.)
ta-participles are a-stems and thus employ the endings introduced in Chapter 6 (Nom Sg -taḥ,
Acc Sg -tam etc.). They are adjectives in the sense that they agree in case, number and gender with
whatever noun they refer to (see the examples under ‘Use of participles and especially the ta-participle’ below), and can be used to refer to any noun in a sentence. The absolutive, on the other
hand, is indeclinable, i.e. it does not add any ending after the -tvā. It can refer only to the agent of
a sentence, i.e. the subject of an active verb or the instrumental-case agent of a passive verb (again,
see ‘Use of participles and especially the ta-participle’ below on this use of the instrumental). Thus,
in e.g. गृहं गत्वा नरः विशति ‘having gone to the house, the man enters’, it is understood that the person
going to the house is the same as the person entering the house, the subject of the main verb.
Some Formal Irregularities
There are a number of ways in which the shape of absolutives and ta-participles can diverge from
the regular pattern just described. It is necessary to be aware of them so as to still recognise which
verb a particular form comes from.
-iSome verbal roots that end in a consonant add the vowel -i- before the suffixes -tvā, -tya or -ta-
(i.e. before suffixes beginning with a t-): √पत ‘to fall, to fly’ –› ् पतित- and पतित्वा ‘having fallen’;

√लिख् ‘to write’: लिखित- ‘having been written’, लिखित्वा ‘having written’. This -i- does not change
the meaning of these forms in any way, and one cannot predict from looking at a root whether the
-i- will appear or not. Across different times and literary genres, there are verbs that sometimes display the -i- and sometimes do not. It would be ideal to memorise whether and when an -i- does or
does not appear in any given verb; it is simplest just to be able to recognise the -i- whenever it does
appear (and thus to recognise that a form such as लिखित्वा does not come from a hitherto unknown
root +
√लिखि, but simply from √लिख्).
The only predictability is found in causative stems and in roots that form Class X presents: these
regularly form their ta-participles in -ita, their absolutives in -ayitvā and their infinitives in -ayitum:
from √पत ‘to fall,’ (I ् पतति) we find the causative पातयति ‘he causes (someone) to fall’, the ta-participle
पातित- ‘having been caused to fall’, the absolutive पातयित्वा ‘having caused to fall’ and the infinitive
पातयितुम् ‘to cause to fall’. Note that causatives keep their strengthened root vowels in these forms.
See also the Linguistic Note on seṭ/aniṭ in Chapter 21.
Unexpected Appearance of Guṇa
Some roots have guṇa (–› Chapter 7 on vowel grades) in both their absolutives and their ta-participles (such as √रक् ‘to protect’ –› ष् रक्षित-; √पत ‘to fall; fly’ –› ् पतित-). This cannot be predicted; be
prepared to recognise these forms (by looking at their suffixes and endings) in spite of this formal
exception.
BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO INTERNAL SANDHI
The unexpected presence of the -i- does not cause any noteworthy difficulties in identifying the verbal
root that a participle or absolutive is derived from. Yet whenever a root-final consonant comes to stand
directly next to another consonant (here, the initial t- of the suffixes), it may change, and this may make
the resulting form more difficult to recognise. This process of sounds changing according to their environment is known as sandhi (Sanskrit संधि-, literally ‘putting together’). We have already encountered it
in the change of -n- to -ṇ- in words that contain r, ṛ, ṝ or ṣ (–› Chapter 6).
This phenomenon may seem odd at first sight, yet consider how it occurs in English: the ending
-s (whether to mark the plural of a noun or the 3rd Sg of a verb) is pronounced either as voiceless
[s] if a voiceless sound precedes (he sinks, cats) or as a voiced [z] when a voiced sounds precedes
(he sings, dogs). The sound environment decides which exact form the ending takes, in English
just as in Sanskrit; the main difference is that English usually does not mark this in writing, while
Sanskrit always does. (Sometimes, even English reflects such pronunciation changes in its spelling:
the prefix ‘in-’ that negates words (inevitable, inadequate etc.) is changed both in pronunciation
8
83
and spelling to im- in words such as impossible or improbable. Technically put, the dental nasal n
turns into the labial nasal m in front of a labial stop (here, p or b).)
Sandhi is found both within words (‘internal sandhi’) and between words (‘external sandhi’). The
various forms of internal sandhi will be explained throughout this book whenever they become
relevant. External sandhi will be introduced in Chapters 11, 13 and 16.
Internal Sandhi before t
Much of internal consonant sandhi involves sounds changing and becoming easier to pronounce
together, often by becoming more similar to each other. t is a voiceless, unaspirated stop. If a verbal root ends in a stop, that stop will also become voiceless or unaspirated when it is followed by
(voiceless, unaspirated) t: d changes into t, b changes into p etc. Palatal stops, furthermore, turn
into a velar – in this case, specifically, the voiceless unaspirated velar, k. Some examples:
√छिद ‘cut’ –›
् छित्त्वा ‘having cut’ (with d > t)
√मुच् ‘to release’ –› मुक्त्वा ‘having released’ (with c > k)
√युज् ‘to join, link’ –› युक्त- ‘having been joined’ (with j > c > k)
Buddha Sandhi
There is one exception to this. When a root ends in a stop that is both voiced and aspirated, it does
not lose these qualities in front of a following t; instead, this voiced aspirate passes them on to the
t and thus turns the t into a dh. In that process, the original voiced aspirate loses its aspiration, and
so a combination of:
dh + t results in ddh
bh + t results in bdh
h + t results in gdh
What appears in Sanskrit as h was often originally a gh. Between vowels it appears as an h; yet before
a consonant it still behaves like the gh it once was; thus it also appears in this list. Some examples:
√बुध् ‘to awake’ –› बुद््ध वा ‘having woken (someone) up’
√लभ् ‘to take’ –› लब्ध्वा ‘having taken’
√दह् ‘to burn’ –› दग्ध- ‘having been burnt’
बुद्ध- is ‘having been awakened’ and thus ‘enlightened’; the Buddha literally is ‘the
awakened one’. The virāma in बुद््ध वा is solely there to keep the combination of -ddhvlegible.
8
84
ś plus t
There is one more situation in which both the stem-final consonant and the -t- of the -ta- change:
before t, root-final ś changes into ṣ. After this retroflex ṣ, t turns into the equivalent retroflex ṭ:
√दृश् ‘to see’ –› दृष्ट- ‘having been seen’
Nasal before t and Other Consonants
Before the dental stop t, nasals turn into the dental nasal n. A parallel phenomenon is found
word-internally before other stops: before a velar stop, the velar nasal ṅ appears; before a palatal
stop, the palatal nasal ñ, and so on. Before consonants that are not stops (y r l v, ś ṣ s, h), nasals
appear as anusvāra ṃ.
USE OF PARTICIPLES AND ESPECIALLY THE TA-PARTICIPLE
Participles are adjectives formed from verbal roots, and thus known as verbal adjectives (–› Chapter 9 for details on adjectives in Sanskrit). They have three kinds of usage: 1) attributive (like an
adjective), 2) substantivised (like a noun), 3) instead of a finite verb.
1) Attributive
As was outlined in the Road Map on nominals (Chapter 5), adjectives, including participles, have
forms for all cases and all genders, and need to agree with whatever noun or pronoun they describe. Yet, as they are derived from verbs, participles such as e.g. दृष्ट- ‘having been seen’ often have
a more strongly verbal meaning than regular adjectives such as प्रिय- ‘dear’. This often means that a
Sanskrit participle is best translated into English as a relative clause:
दूतं मुक्तं पश्यामि not +
‘I see the having-been-freed messenger’ but ‘I see the
messenger who has been freed’
नरः मुक्तः ग्रामं गच्छति ‘the man who was freed (not +
‘the having-been-freed man’)
goes to his village’
2) Substantivised
Participles, like adjectives in general, can be used on their own. In its masculine form, an adjective
like प्रिय- ‘dear’ would then mean ‘the/a dear man’, in its feminine form ‘the/a dear woman’ and in
the neuter ‘the/a dear thing’. If we change the above example to मुक्तां पश्यति it literally translates
as +
‘he sees the having-been-freed feminine one’ –› ‘he sees the woman who has been freed’.
8
85
3) Instead of a Finite Verb
The ta-participle may also be used as the main verb of a clause. One can recognise that this is the
case when there is no finite verb present. Depending on whether the specific ta-participle has
active or passive meaning, it needs to be translated as a past active or passive verb, respectively:
नराः पुरं गताः । ‘The men went to the city.’
पुरं दृष्टम् । ‘The city was seen.’
The agent of a passive verb form (whether finite (–› Chapter 21) or not) is expressed in the instrumental (or sometimes the genitive) case:
नरेण/नरस्य अश्वः दृष्टः। ‘The horse was seen by the man.’
नरैः/नराणां पुरं दृष्टम् । ‘The city was seen by the men.’
नरेण/नरस्य श्रुतः अश्वः द्रवति । ‘The horse that was heard by the man is running.’
All examples in this section used just one participle – the ta-participle – as that is the
only one that has already been introduced. Especially usages 1 and 2 are very common
also with all other participles, which are introduced in the following chapters: present
and future active (25), present middle and passive and future middle (22), perfect active
and middle/passive (35).
THE INFINITIVE
The Sanskrit infinitive, expressing ‘to do’, ‘to run’, ‘to eat’ etc., is formed by adding the suffix -tum
to the verbal root in guṇa: e.g. √नी –› नेतुम् ‘to lead’; √श् –› रु श्रोतुम् ‘to hear’. Infinitives display the
same formal variations as ta-participles and absolutives do: a number of roots insert an -i- before
the -tum (such as √पत –› ् पतितुम् ‘to fall’). In verbs that do not insert the -i-, there is sandhi of the
root-final consonant (identical to that before -ta- or -tvā; –› √बुध् –› बोद्धु
म् ‘to understand’). As described above, m changes into n before t-, giving e.g. गन्तुम् ‘to go’ from √गम्. There is some overlap
between verbs that add this -i- in their ta-participle and absolutive and verbs that add the -i- in
their infinitive; yet the two groups are not identical (–› e.g. √भू –› भवितुम् ‘to be’, but भूत- and भूत्वा
‘having been’). And again, a number of verbs have different infinitives in different times or literary
genres (e.g. √शुच् ‘to mourn’ has both शोचितुम् and शोक्तुम्).
8
Infinitives of Class X verbs and causatives are formed from their present stem minus the final -a-:
चिन्तयति ‘he thinks’ –› चिन्तयितुम् ‘to think’; भारयति ‘he causes to carry’ –› भारयितुम् ‘to cause to carry’.
Infinitives are used after verbs expressing ‘to want/to hope/to intend/to go’ (etc.) to do something:
नगरं गन्तुम् इच्छामि ‘I want to go to the city’
86
VOCABULARY
Note: The ta-participles and absolutives of the verbs√कृ , √श्रुand √वच् are introduced here as they
are used very frequently. These verbs belong to classes not yet introduced; thus, ignore the question
of how to form any of their other forms for the time being.
√दह् (I दहति) ‘to burn’
√जीव् (I जीवति) ‘to live, be alive’
√वस् (I वसति) ‘to live (in a place)’

CHAPTER 9
ā-Stems
Ā-STEM NOUNS
Chapter 6 introduced a-stem nouns, which were all of either masculine or neuter gender. ā-stem
(read ‘long-a stem’) nouns, on the other hand, are exclusively feminine. The endings of ā-stems
differ from those of a-stems and thus need to be memorised separately. In spite of the formal
differences, the meanings/functions of each case are identical to those of a-stems.
Remember that feminine gender is a grammatical category and does not imply that all ā-stem
nouns refer to biological females. (Yet the reverse is the case: most words for biological females are
grammatically feminine.)
ā-stem noun: सेना- (f.) ‘army’
Singular Dual Plural
Nom सेना

सेनयोः सेनानाम्
Loc सेनायाम् सेनासु
Note:
– The long stem-final -ā is visible throughout most of the paradigm (but note the Instr Sg सेनया,
rather than +
सेनाया, and also the GenLoc Du सेनयोः). Stem-final -ā (or, more generally, stem-final
long vowels) is a clear sign that a noun is feminine (–› Chapter 13 on ī- and ū-stem nouns).
9
93
– The case endings in the dual and plural are largely identical to those of a-stems (but note the
NomVocAcc Du and Instr Pl), thus reducing the number of new forms that need to be memorised. Note the Loc Pl ending -su (not -ṣu, as in the a-stems): the reason for this difference will
be explained below (‘Retroflexion of s’).
ADJECTIVES
As described in the Road Map on Nominals (Chapter 5), adjectives are words that describe qualities: small, smart, green, old etc. As mentioned in Chapter 6, Sanskrit adjectives have different forms
for the three different genders that Sanskrit nouns can belong to: masculine, feminine and neuter.
A large number of adjectives in Sanskrit are a-stems. This means that their masculine forms look
identical to those of masculine a-stem nouns (such as नर- ‘man’) and their neuter forms identical to
those of neuter a-stem nouns (such as वन- ‘forest’). Their feminine forms usually follow the forms
of ā-stem nouns, making a typical a-stem adjective paradigm such as प्रिय- ‘dear’ look as follows:
a-/ā-stem adjective: प्रिय- ‘dear’
Masc Fem Ntr
Nom प्रियः प्रिया प्रियम्
Voc प्रिय प्रिये प्रिय
Acc प्रियम् प्रियाम् प्रियम्
Etc.
(The feminine forms of some a-stem adjectives take not ā-stem, but ī-stem endings, which are
introduced in Chapter 13.)
Note that participles (such as the ta-participles from Chapter 8) are adjectives, in that they have
different forms for the different genders, such as Masc गतः, Fem गता, Ntr गतम्.
Comparatives and Superlatives
Like their English counterparts, Sanskrit adjectives have three ‘degrees’: the positive, the comparative and the superlative. In English, these would be formed either by adding suffixes ( fast, faster,
fastest) or by adding ‘more’ and ‘most’ (beautiful, more beautiful, most beautiful). Sanskrit has two
sets of suffixes to form comparative and superlative: comparative -tara-, superlative -tama-, and
comparative -(ī)yas-, superlative -iṣṭha-.
9
94
Note:
– The suffixes -tara-/-tama- are much more frequent than -(ī)yas-/-iṣṭha-, and are simply added to
the stem of an adjective, as seen in the table above.
– -(ī)yas-/-iṣṭha- are rarer, it is not possible to predict which adjectives use them, and unlike -tara-
/-tama-, they are not just added to the stem, but to a more reduced version of the adjective
whose form cannot be predicted (again, as in the table above). Such forms are listed as separate
vocabulary items in most word lists or dictionaries.
– There is no difference in meaning between forms in -tara-/-tama- and those in -(ī)yas-/-iṣṭha-;
some adjectives are even found with either set of suffixes (thus, forms such as प्रियतर- ‘dearer’
and प्रियतम- ‘dearest’ do appear in some texts).
Superlative forms are often employed together with forms in the genitive or locative:
प्रेः नराणाम् ‘dearest of men’
प्रेः नरेषु ‘dearest among men’
Comparatives stand together with an ablative:
सिहः ं अश्वात शी ् घ्रतरः
‘the lion (is) faster than the horse’
Like basic adjectives, comparative and superlative adjectives have different forms for each gender.
Comparatives and superlatives in -tara-, -tama- and -iṣṭha- are regular a/ā-stems (i.e. they form their
masculine, feminine and neuter exactly like प्रिय-). The declension of comparatives in -(ī)yas- will be
discussed in Chapter 35.
Finally, comparative and superlative forms in Sanskrit have a broader meaning than their English
counterparts: in addition to ‘more x’, comparative forms can also have the meaning of ‘rather/quite x’;
superlative forms may also mean ‘very/excessively x’. These alternative translations may have to
be used whenever there is no actual comparison being made: when a woman is described as प्रेष्ठा
कन्यानाम्, we need to translate ‘the dearest of all girls’. If she is simply described as प्रेष्ठा, we need to
translate this as ‘very’ or ‘exceedingly’ dear.
Comparative and superlative of उग्र- ‘terrible’ and प्रिय- ‘dear’
Positive Comparative Superlative
उग्र- ‘terrible’ उग्रतर- ‘more terrible’ उग्रतम- ‘most terrible’
प्रिय- ‘dear’ प्रेयस्- ‘dearer’ प्रेष्ठ- ‘dearest’
9
95
ADVERBS
Sanskrit uses the Acc Sg Ntr of an adjective to form the respective adverb. Thus we find e.g. नित्यम्
‘always, eternally’ (from नित्य- ‘eternal’), चिरम् ‘for a long time’, सुखम् ‘happily’, or सत्यम् ‘truly’. The
same is found of nouns; thus e.g. नाम ‘… by name, called …’ (Acc Sg of नामन्-, a neuter n-stem
–› Chapter 29), नक्तम् ‘at night’ (नक्त- ‘night’), रहस् ‘in secret, secretly’ (Acc Sg of रहस्-, a neuter sstem –› Chapter 24).
MORE INTERNAL SANDHI: THE RUKI RULE ON THE RETROFLEXION OF S
As we have just seen, the Loc Pl of ā-stems ends in -su rather than the -ṣu known from a-stems.
The reason behind this is explained by the ruki rule. This rule is named after the sounds r, u, k and
i, which effect the sandhi in question. It says the following:
Immediately after r, k or any vowel other than a or ā, s turns into ṣ
even if that intervening vowel is followed by anusvāra (ṃ) or visarga (ḥ)
unless that s stands at the end of a word, or is followed by r.
‘Any vowel other than a’ in effect means i, ī, u, ū, ṛ, ṝ and also e, ai, o, au (which all have, or originally had, either i or u as their final component –› Chapter 7). The rule does not apply at the end of a
word, where -s always turns into -ḥ (see ‘Technical note: Sandhi’ on pp. 39–40). Note that the ruki
rule only applies in close proximity, i.e. to an -s- following directly upon the sounds listed, and so is
unlike the rule concerning the retroflexion of n, which may apply across an entire word.
सेनासु ‘in armies’ but नरेषु ‘in men’ मनःसु ‘in minds’ but धनुःषु ‘in bows’
-s- is preceded
by -ā-, thus
remains as -s-
-s- is preceded
by -e-, thus
turns into -ṣ-
-s- is preceded
by -a- plus
visarga: stays as
it is
in spite of the
intervening visarga,
the preceding -uturns -s- into -ṣRetroflexion affects -s- or -n- in any suffix or ending. Yet it is not limited to this, but applies to
anywhere within a word. Thus, in Sanskrit you will e.g. only ever find kṣ and never ks. In words like
the name Kṛṣṇa, retroflexion of both ṣ (after ṛ) and of ṇ (after ṣ) are found.
In a nutshell: under specific conditions, s can appear as ṣ (and n as ṇ) without
any change in meaning of the form they stand in.
Turn to the section on internal sandhi in the Reference Grammar (Appendix III ) for a
poetic illustration of ruki.

STYLISTIC NOTE: ‘TO GO’ AND ABSTRACT NOUNS
In Sanskrit, a noun in the accusative used together with a verb meaning to go (such as √गम्) expresses the goal of the movement, i.e. usually the place to which someone is going (such as पुरं गच्छति
‘he goes to the city’). Yet in addition to nouns referring to a place, Sanskrit also employs nouns
referring to abstract qualities: शान्तिम् अधिगच्छति lit. ‘he goes towards peace’. Such expressions
cannot be translated literally into English, but should be rendered as ‘become…’: here ‘become
quiet, peaceful’; सिद्धिं गच्छति ‘goes to success’ –› ‘becomes successful, finds success’; विस्मयं गच्छति
‘goes towards astonishment’ –› ‘becomes/is astonished’ etc.
SYNTACTIC NOTE: RELATIVE CLAUSES IN A NUTSHELL
Relative clauses are a common occurrence in Sanskrit. Because of the wealth of forms of the relative pronoun, they will not be systematically introduced until Chapter 23. Yet as they will appear in
a number of the earlier Reading passages, a brief introduction is in order here.
Relative clauses give more information on a word in the main clause. For example, in ‘the cake
that I ate tasted good’, the relative clause is ‘that I ate’ and the word that it gives more information
about is ‘cake’. The pronoun introducing a relative clause (here: ‘that’) is called a relative pronoun.
When it is used in English, it stands at the beginning of the relative clause, and the clause as a whole
follows the noun that it describes.
In Sanskrit, the word that the relative clause refers to may stand before, within or after the relative
clause; the relative pronoun in the relative clause is almost always balanced by a demonstrative pronoun (‘this’, ‘that’, ‘they’ etc.) in the main clause; and, very noticeably, the relative and demonstrative pronouns do not need to stand at the beginning of their respective clauses. Literally, a sentence
including a Sanskrit relative clause might thus translate into ‘which cake I ate, that tasted good’ or
‘cake I ate which, tasted good that.’ Frequently found pairs of relative and demonstrative include
यः… सः (or स) ‘who… he/this person’ (Nom Sg Masc), ये… त ‘which/who े … they’ (Nom Pl Masc)
and यद…् तद्‘which… that’ (Nom Sg Ntr). In the Notes to the Reading passages, these kinds of
construction will be referred to as ‘relative structure’.

CHAPTER 10
Prepositions and Preverbs
PREPOSITIONS
Prepositions are words such as to, for, into, without, from etc. They give us information about the
role that the nouns and pronouns they stand with play in a given sentence: I give this book to you
(indirect object). The book lies on the table (place where). He cut the cake with a knife (instrument). In English, prepositions are numerous and frequently employed, and always stand in front
of the noun or pronoun (hence the name pre-position).
Sanskrit, on the other hand, is an inflected language that can draw on case endings to mark the
role that a noun plays in a sentence. Thus it only has a small number of prepositions in regular use.
These, furthermore, stand behind the noun that they belong to, not in front of it (thus, properly
speaking, they are post-positions). The most frequently used prepositions are:
प्रति (+ Acc) ‘towards’: नगरं प्रति ‘towards the city’
सह (+ Instr) ‘with’: मित्रैः सह ‘together with friends’
विना (+ Instr, Acc or Abl) ‘without’: भयेन/भयं/भयात् विना ‘without fear’
PREVERBS
Related, but far more frequent in Sanskrit, is the use of preverbs, which are added to the front of a verb:
अप- means ‘away, off ’ –› अपगच्छन्ति means ‘they go away, they depart’
आ- means ‘in this direction, hither’ –› आगच्छति means ‘he comes’
प्रति- means ‘towards, back to’ –› पुरं प्रतिगच्छसि means ‘you go back to the city’
or ‘you approach the city’
Some of these, such as प्रति, can function both as prepositions and as preverbs, and may then vary
in meaning (as a preposition, प्रति expresses the idea of ‘towards’; as a preverb, it can mean ‘towards’,
but also ‘back to’). A list of the preverbs employed on a regular basis is given in the Vocabulary
section below.
10
102
Verbs that employ a preverb are called compound verbs. A few aspects of their use need to be
pointed out.
1) Preverbs cannot always be translated into English. How strongly a preverb affects the meaning of a compound verb depends on the meaning of the underlying, basic verb. Verbs that
have a relatively general meaning, especially verbs expressing motion (such as √गम् or √द्), are रु
made more specific in their meaning: the preverb now specifies the direction of the movement.
Thus we find e.g. अनु-√गम् ‘to follow’ (अनु- ‘after’), अप-√गम् ‘to go away’ (अप- ‘away’), or सम्-
√गम् ‘to come together, assemble’ (सम्- ‘together’). On the other hand, when verbs of more
specific meaning are combined with preverbs, this may have a much more subtle effect: √श्रु
means ‘to hear, to listen’; उप-√श्, literally ‘to listen towards’, may express listening more intent रु -
ly. Frequently, different preverbs are used for different idioms: अव-√मुच्, उद-√मुच्, ् निर्-√मुच्,
परि-√मुच् or प्र-√मुच् all mean more or less the same as their relatively specific basic verb √मुच्
‘to release’; yet while अव-√मुच् may be used to express taking off (‘releasing’) one’s clothing,
प्र-√मुच् is typically used intransitively to refer to fruit falling/‘being released from’ their tree.
Similarly, नम् means ‘to bend, to bow’; प्र-√नम्, literally meaning ‘to bend/bow forwards’ or ‘to
bow in front of ’, develops into the basic expression for bowing to someone in respect or reverence. Different preverbs may also be used in texts from different times – e.g. Vedic vs. Classical
Sanskrit – to express the same thing. Thus, when you find a compound verb with a verbal base
that already has a fairly specific meaning, it is a good first approach to try to translate the compound verb as you would the basic verb.
2) There are verbs that have two, or even three, preverbs. Based on √गम् ‘to go’, we find आ-√गम् ‘to
come’, परि-√गम् ‘to go around; to reach’; परि-आ-√गम् ‘to arrive at, reach one’s goal’; परि-उप-आ-
√गम् ‘to surround’; as well as various other combinations. (Admittedly, three preverbs at once are
rare.)
3) While the meaning of a compound verb can frequently be predicted from the meaning of
its parts, it often also cannot. Take परि-उप-आ-√गम् ‘to surround’ mentioned above: looking
at the combination of परि- ‘around’, उप- ‘towards’ and आ- ‘here, hither’ combined with √गम्,
it is difficult to infer the exact meaning ‘to surround’. Sometimes, there is also no obvious
link between basic and compound verb: अव-√गम् ‘to understand’ (अव- ‘down, off ’) does not
immediately appear to reflect the meaning of preverb or basic verb. (Neither does its English
counterpart, ‘to understand’.) Thus, if neither translating just the basic verb nor combining the
literal meaning of the verb with that of the preverb(s) works, you will have to look the compound verb up in a dictionary. (See ‘How to use a Sanskrit Dictionary’ in Chapter 36. Up to
that point, this book lists the meaning of any compound verb whose meaning is not straightforward.)
4) Sometimes, the preverb causes internal sandhi. Retroflexion of s or n to ṣ or ṇ is particularly
frequent (प्र- +√नम् ‘to bow forwards; to bow’, for example, results in 3rd Sg प्रणमति; उद-् +√स्था
10
103
‘to stand up’ gives us उत्तिष्ठति; उप-नि-√सद ‘to sit ( ् √सद) down ( ् नि-) near or facing (उप-)
someone’ gives us the 3rd Sg उपनिषीदति. Some dictionaries list compound verbs by reference
to the basic verb. Thus अनु-√नी, आ-√नी, प्र-√नी etc. can all be found under the entry for √नी,
which then has various sub-entries for the meaning of √नी in combination with each preverb.
Thus, make sure you are looking up the right basic verb.
5) In many dictionaries (and in this book), compound verbs are listed under their root. Thus, a
form such as सं गच्छन्ति will be listed in the entry for √गम्, in a sub-entry on सम्-√गम्.
(Finally, relevant for Chapters 12 and 28, respectively: augments and reduplicative
syllables stand between the verbal stem and any preverb(s); make sure you analyse forms
such as पर्यगच्छत correctly ( ् परि-अ-गच्छत ‘he went around’), and do not miss the presence ्
of augments after preverbs ending in an -a or even -ā (such as पर्युपागच्छत, which could be ्
either परि-उप-अ-गच्छत ‘he arrived’ or also ् परि-उप-आ-अगच्छत ‘he surrounded’). ्
Absolutives of Compound Verbs
As was mentioned briefly in Chapter 8, compound verbs form their absolutives with a different
suffix from that used in simple verbs: if the verbal root in zero grade ends in a short vowel, they add
-tya, in all other cases -ya. Thus √नी ‘to lead’ forms an absolutive नीत्वा ‘having led’, but अप-√नी ‘to
lead away’ forms an absolutive अपनीय ‘having led away’. √द् ‘to run’ has an absolutive
रु द्रुत्वा ‘having
run’, while the absolutive of अप-√द्रुis अपद्त्यरु ‘having run away’.
Practicalities
Preverbs are short and sound similar, making them difficult to memorise and keep apart. Here are
a few ways of remembering the list below more easily:
– अधि-, अपि-, अभि-, अनु-, उप- have similar functions: all express a motion towards.
– A number of these are related (and thus look similar) to preverbs in Latin and Greek that have
been borrowed into English. Generally put, -a- in Sanskrit corresponds to various other vowels
in related Western languages: अन्तर्- ‘between’ is related to inter (as in e.g. international ‘among/
between nations’); प्र- ‘forward’ is related to pro- (as in e.g. progress, i.e. movement forward);
परि- ‘around’ is related to peri- in e.g. periphery (the boundary or area around something); अप-
‘away’ is related to apo-, which you may have heard of in scientific terminology (e.g. the apogee
as the point furthest away from earth) or in words such as apostle (someone sent away, out to
spread news). सम्- ‘with, together’ can be found in words like assemble, i.e. to come or put together.
– In order to translate from Sanskrit, you mainly need to be able to recognise the various preverbs
and to split them up so that you can identify the verb they have been added to.
10
MORE INTERNAL SANDHI: VOWELS AND NASALS
The concept of internal sandhi was introduced in Chapter 8. It is not just consonants, but also vowels
that change their pronunciation when they encounter other sounds. Whenever a vowel meets another
identical vowel, they merge to become one long vowel (a/ā + a/ā –› ā; i/ī + i/ī –› ī; u/ū + u/ū –› ū). Thus,
a verb like उप-आ-√नी ‘to bring near, fetch’ appears as e.g. 3rd Sg उपानयति ‘he brings’. Whenever an i/ī or
a u/ū encounter a vowel other than themselves, they turn into y or v, respectively (as in e.g. वि-अप-
√नी ‘to lead away’, 3rd Sgव्यपनयति; or अधि-आ-√गम् ‘to come upon, find’, 3rd Sg अध्यागच्छति). When an
a/ā encounters a vowel other than itself, it merges with it to form a new vowel: for example, a/ā +i
gives e, a/ā + u gives o (as in e.g. प्र-उद-√धृ ् ‘to raise’, 3rd Sg प्रोद्धरयति; –› Chapter 7 on the details of this).
As we saw in Chapter 8, when a voiced consonant is followed by an unvoiced consonant, it loses its
voice (thus we find e.g. उद-√् स्था –› 3rd Sg उत्तिष्ठति ‘he stands up’). And finally, -m in preverbs (i.e. in
sam-) remains as -m before a vowel, but turns into anusvāra -ṃ before a consonant (and thus we
find सम्-आ-√गम् –› 3rd Pl समागच्छन्ति, but सम्-√गम् –› सं गच्छन्ति both meaning ‘they come together,
assemble’).

THE NUTSHELL
Preverbs may change the meaning of a verb, fundamentally or marginally, but do not
necessarily do so. Do not automatically expect to translate a given preverb.
Be able to identify all individual preverbs, even if you cannot immediately translate them.
Preverbs may cause internal sandhi: make sure you identify the basic verb correctly.
In a number of dictionaries, compound verb forms are listed under the root of the simple verb.
Augments (–› Chapter 12) and reduplicative syllables (–› Chapter 28) stand between the
preverb(s) and the basic verb.

READINGS
Note: As mentioned in Chapter 5, Sanskrit has several different declensions, i.e. different sets
of case endings. Yet a number of those endings are identical or very similar across declensions
(such as Acc Sg -m or Loc Pl -su). To encourage you to remember those similarities and use
them to your advantage, recognisable forms from declensions not yet introduced will not be
analysed for you, but marked as ‘guess case from ending’ from now on.

CHAPTER 11
Introduction to External Sandhi I; Consonant Sandhi
INTRODUCTION TO EXTERNAL SANDHI
Say the following two sentences aloud:
Do you want some more chocolate?
Don’t you want some more chocolate?
For many English speakers, there is a difference in how the first sound of the word you in these two
sentences is pronounced: combining the -t of don’t with the y- of you, the result is something like
dontchou. Or listen to how you say in between – many pronounce this as imbetween. In English spelling, each word is written separately and always spelled in the same way, no matter what word follows.
This helps readers recognise the words they see on the page. Sanskrit does this differently: rather than
writing words so that they are individually recognisable straight away, Sanskrit writing marks how the
pronunciation of words changes when they stand next to other words. This has the advantage that,
when we see any Sanskrit written, we know how it is to be pronounced with a much greater degree of
accuracy. The rules describing how words change when they are put together in a sentence are those
of external sandhi (saṃ-dhi- (lit.) ‘putting (–› √dhā, Chapter 19) together (sam-)’). It can be summed
up as follows:
Sanskrit words regularly change their pronunciation when they stand together with other
words. Sanskrit spelling marks all these changes. This process is called external sandhi,
and its general principles are quite simple:
1) The last sound of a word changes, depending on the first sound of the next word.
Sometimes, that first sound also changes.
2) A consonant at the end of a word becomes more similar to the first sound of the
next word.
3) A vowel at the end of a word interacts (and usually merges) with a following vowel.
It remains the same when a consonant follows.
The box above outlines everything you need to know about sandhi right now. This chapter explains the various manifestations that Rule 2 can take, with the exception of final -ḥ (which will
11
110
be explained in Chapter 13); Rule 3 (on vowel sandhi) will be discussed in Chapter 16. All three
discussions of sandhi will include a daunting number of small details. Don’t worry too much about
these right now, but instead focus on the principles outlined above. The best way of familiarising
yourself with the single sandhi manifestations is to take regular recourse to the sandhi charts in
each section (which are reprinted together in the Reference Grammar in Appendix III) whenever
a Sanskrit text is read and a particular application of sandhi is unclear.
CONSONANT SANDHI
A consonant at the end of a word becomes more similar to the first sound of the next word.
‘Becoming more similar’ means the following: if, for example, a word ends in a voiceless consonant
and the next word begins with a voiced sound (i.e. either a voiced consonant or one of the vowels,
which are always voiced), the word-final voiceless consonant becomes voiced. Thus, t becomes d,
or k becomes g.
नगरात् ग्रामं गच्छति ‘He is going from the city to the village.’ –› नगराद्ग्रामं गच्छति
By the same principle, before a word-initial nasal, preceding final stops turn into the equivalent nasal.
ग्रामं नगरात् न गच्छति ‘He is not going to the village from the city.’ –› ग्रामं नगरान् न गच्छति
(Similarly, final -t becomes retroflex before a word-initial retroflex sound; yet this is very rare.)
The aspiration of initial consonants (as in kh-, gh-, ch- etc.) does not affect what precedes. Initial
h-, on the other hand, does change preceding word-final stops: it voices them and itself turns into
the corresponding aspirated stop.
नगरात् हि गच्छति ‘He is indeed (हि) going away from the city.’ –› नगराद्धि गच्छति
‘Permitted Final Sounds’
At the end of a Sanskrit word, i.e. in word-final position, we only find a handful of consonants.
No voiced or aspirated stops appear, and palatal sounds are absent entirely. This limits the list
of possible external sandhi combinations involving stops, which can thus be given as in the table below. The top row represents the possible word-final sounds; the far-right column represents
the sounds at the beginning of the following word. The main grid shows the resulting word-final
sounds after sandhi has been applied.

Overview of external consonant sandhi (fields before voiced initial sounds are shaded)
Note:
1
 When word-final -n (or more rarely, -ṅ) is preceded by a short vowel and the next word begins
with a vowel, the -n/ṅ doubles: smayan iva –› smayann iva.
2
 Between a word-final -n and any initial voiceless sound that is formed using the tongue (c-/ch-, ṭ-
/ṭh-, t-/th-), an s-sound is inserted. Before the palatal c/ch, the palatal ś is added; before the retroflex
ṭ/ṭh, a retroflex ṣ, and before dental t/th, a dental s. Before that s-sound, the n turns into anusvāra ṃ:
kasmin cit –› kasmiṃś cit.
11
112
3 While sandhi primarily affects the word-final sounds, there are a few cases in which the initial sound
of the next word is also affected: agacchat hi –› agacchad dhi. The new forms of these word-initial
sounds are given in brackets after the sandhied word-final consonants in the grid. In the combination
of final ñ and initial ś, ś may remain the same or change into ch.
4 The sign used above the l is the anunāsika. Its devanāgarī representation is ँ
, and it is pronounced
like an anusvāra, yet it nasalises consonants, not vowels. (Try to pronounce an l while at the same
time producing the hum-like nasalised sound of the anusvāra.)
Writing Conventions
So far, the virāma (the small diagonal stroke at the bottom of e.g. -त) has been used to indicate that ्
a word ends with a consonant rather than a vowel. Actual Sanskrit writing, however, avoids use of
the virāma by omitting the gap between two words entirely. Whenever a word has been written
with final consonant plus virāma so far, it should properly have been linked up with the initial
sound of the following word:
नगरात् हि गच्छति –› नगराद्धि गच्छति –› नगराद्धि गच्छति ‘He is indeed going away from the city’,
नगरात् न गच्छति –› नगरान् न गच्छति –› नगरान्न गच्छति ‘He is not going away from the city.’
नगरात् आगच्छति –› नगराद आग ् च्छति –› नगरादागच्छति ‘He is coming from the city.’
The same happens in most instances of external vowel sandhi –› Chapter 16.
This complicates reading Sanskrit a great deal: from now on, whenever you cannot identify a
word, check whether it might actually be two or more words that have been combined in writing.
Be especially careful not to overlook initial a- after a word ending in a consonant. As we know,
short a that follows upon a consonant is not indicated in devanāgarī writing. Thus, following the
writing conventions just outlined, *नगराद अपग ् च्छति ‘he is going away from the city’ appears as
नगरादपगच्छति. Having identified नगराद, it is an easy mistake to then see the - ् p- as the next sound
and ignore the -a- between the two. Be aware of this potential pitfall.
Note that final consonants are linked in writing with the next word only if the use of a virāma were
otherwise required (as in *नगराद अपग ् च्छति –› नगरादपगच्छति). If a word ends in anusvāra -ṃ or
visarga -ḥ after sandhi has been applied, this -ṃ or -ḥ is not linked with the following word. Thus
words such as नरं पश्यामि ‘I see a man’ remain written separately.
Finally, in some conjuncts consisting of three or more consonants, a number of Sanskrit
fonts use a virāma to retain legibility; –› e.g. बुद््ध वा ‘having understood’. Do not let this
confuse you.
11
Beginners’ Sandhi: Some Practical Remarks
Reading sandhied texts takes quite a while to get used to. Do not worry if you find it difficult – it is
difficult. The progress you will make may be slow, but it will be steady. From this point on, the sandhi
rules introduced so far have been applied to all Sanskrit examples and texts. Through this constant
exposure, they will become familiar to you soon. Remember: memorise the basic principles outlined at the beginning of this chapter and use the tables at the back for reference. It may be useful to
make a photocopy of the sandhi tables on pp. 387–9 in the Appendices and to keep it in whatever
place of the book you are at. Soon you will find yourself consulting those tables less and less.
If you do wish to memorise any part of the sandhi table above, leave the columns concerning ṭ, p
and ṅ aside for the time being, as these letters occur at the end of words only rarely. Of the consonants, -t, -n and -m are found in word-final position most frequently. You already know the sandhi
patterns of -m: it surfaces as -m before vowels and if no word follows, and as -ṃ everywhere else;
so memorise the columns for final -t and -n.

CHAPTER 12
Imperfect Indicative and Present Potential
These two paradigms use the same endings everywhere except for the 1st Sg and the 3rd Pl. They are
thus introduced together here, even though they are unrelated in their meaning/function.
MEANING
The imperfect tense refers to the past: while the 3rd Sg Pres Ind भरति means ‘he carries’, its imperfect
equivalent अभरत means ‘he carried’. The ् potential mood (also called ‘subjunctive’ or ‘optative’ in
some grammars) refers to what is possible. Thus the 3rd Sg Pres Pot भरेत can be used to express sim ् -
ple possibility (‘he may, might carry’), what is wished for (‘he should, ought to carry’), also what will
be (‘he will carry’), and conditional clauses (‘if he carried, were to carry’). In the 1stDu and Pl, it may
also express the idea of ‘let’s carry’. The potential mood is regularly used only of the present tense.
FORMS
As we saw in Chapter 4, a number of the present-tense verb forms are marked by the final vowel
-i: भरामि, भरसि, भरति, 3rd Pl भरन्ति. Imperfect and potential also have this kind of ‘signature’ vowel
that helps us recognise them: the imperfect paradigm is marked with an augment, the vowel a- at
the beginning of each form. This is a marker of ‘pastness’ that is also found in another kind of
past tense, the aorist (which will be discussed in Chapter 38). The potential, on the other hand, is
marked by the vowel -e- that appears directly before the ending. Look at the imperfect indicative
and present potential of √भृ ‘to carry’:
Imperfect indicative and present potential of √भृ ‘to carry’ (For tables listing each paradigm
individually, see the Reference Grammar, pp. 400.)
Singular Dual Plural
Imperfect Potential Imperfect Potential Imperfect Potential
1st अभरम् भरेयम् अभराव भरेव अभराम भरेम
2nd अभर: भरेः अभरतम् भरेतम् अभरत भरेत
3rd अभरत् भरेत् अभरताम् भरेताम् अभरन् भरेयुः
12
119
The endings, parallel in all forms but the 1st Sg and 3rd Pl, make memorising the two sets of forms
easier. In some forms, comparison with the present tense helps even further: in the singular, the
pattern of m, s, t repeats throughout (āmi, asi, ati – am, as, at – eyam, es, et; this pattern is made
less obvious by the fact that word-final -s changed into -ḥ through sandhi; –› Chapters 4 and 13 for
details), and the first persons dual and plural all include -va- and -ma-, respectively. The endings
used in the present are called primary, those employed in imperfect and potential secondary.
For anyone who finds it easier to memorise specifically the new endings, they are given in the table
below. Note that before its 1st Sg and 3rd Pl endings, the potential inserts a -y-.
Two Notes on the Augment
– The augment is placed right in front of the verbal root. If a verb has any preverbs, the augment
comes after them:
प्रति-अ-गच्छत् –› प्रत्यगच्छत्
(–› Chapter 10 to remind yourself how the final vowel of a preverb may change when it
encounters the augment a-.)
– Verbs beginning with a vowel are augmented by putting this initial vowel into vṛddhi:
Present इच्छति –› Imperfect ऐच्छत्
-(a)m -va -ma
- ḥ -tam -ta
-t -tām -an/-uḥ

CHAPTER 13
ī- and ū-Stems; Sandhi II: Visarga Sandhi
Ī- AND Ū-STEMS
Chapter 9 introduced ā-stems. There are two more stems ending in long vowels, namely ī- and ū-stems.
Nouns belonging to these stems also are exclusively feminine, and furthermore have endings that are
very similar to those of ā-stems. It thus is helpful to look at them in comparison with each other.
There are two varieties of both ī- and ū-stems: regular and monosyllabic or ‘root’ stems. Look over
the three paradigms given overleaf and read the notes intended to help with memorisation. (ūstems are entirely parallel to ī-stems and will be discussed further down.)
REGULAR Ī-STEMS
In their endings, these greatly overlap with ā-stems; yet they diverge in the Voc Sg and the NomVoc
Acc Du. Also, while ā-stems add a -y- between stem and ending in InstrDatAblGenLoc Sg, ī-stems
add the ending right to their stem. Where endings begin with a vowel, internal sandhi turns stem-final ī into y (hence nady-ā etc.). In the Nom Pl, t he same ending (-aḥ) is employed in both ā- and īstems. It combines with stem-final -ā to give *-ā-aḥ > -āḥ, and with stem-final -ī to give *-ī-aḥ >-yaḥ.
ROOT Ī-STEMS
These can be recognised by the fact that, without any endings, they have just one syllable. They differ
from regular ī-stems in some case endings: the Nom Sg ends in -ḥ; the DatAblGenLoc Sg and Gen
Pl may have the same endings as ā- and regular ī-stems (giving धियै, धियः, धियाम्, धीनाम्; see shaded fields) or also alternative endings (धिये, धियः, धियि, धियाम्). As we will see in Chapter 15, these
alternative endings are those of consonant stems. They furthermore differ from regular ī-stems in
that, before an ending that begins with a vowel, the stem-final -ī changes not into a -y-, but into -iy-
(hence धिया rather than +
ध्या), which minimises the number of forms consisting of just one syllable.
Ū-STEMS
Once we are familiar with ī-stems, ū-stems are easy to memorise, given their formal parallels to
ī-stems. Here, too, there are regular and root-stems. ū-stems have the same endings as their ī-stem
counterparts in all cases except for the Nom Sg, which even in regular ū-stems ends in -ḥ, while that

of regular ī-stems does not (e.g. Nom Sg चमूः vs. Nom Sg नदी). Their internal sandhi also is parallel:
where stem-final -ī changes into -y- or -iy-, stem-final -ū changes into -v- or -uv-, respectively. To
give a few examples: चमू- ‘army’ has an Acc Sg चमूम् and an Instr Sg चम्वा. The root stem भू- ‘earth’
has a Nom Sg भूः, and Acc Sg भुवम् and an Instr Sg भुवा. Full ū-stem paradigms are given in the
Reference Grammar (Appendix III).

Before vowels, -ū > -v-/-uv-.
FEMININE NOUNS FORMED FROM MASCULINE NOUNS
A number of nouns in -ī are the feminine equivalents of masculine nouns (which may belong to
various stems): देवी- ‘goddess’ from देव- ‘god’; दासी- ‘female servant’ from दास- ‘servant’; नारी- ‘woman’ from नर- (with vṛddhi of first syllable –› Chapter 17), सखी- ‘female friend’ from सखि- ‘friend’
(Chapter 26), राज्ञी- ‘queen’ from राजन्- ‘king’ (Chapter 29). The same is the case with some nouns in
-ā: –› बाला- ‘girl’ from बाल- ‘boy’; आत्मजा- ‘daughter’ from आत्मज- ‘son’. Where the meaning of such
forms is straightforward and can be inferred from the basic masculine noun, the feminines will not
always be explicitly explained in this book. Be prepared to recognise them.
You may now do Exercises 1 and 2.
ADJECTIVE AGREEMENT
So far, we have only seen adjectives and nouns that belong to the same declension and thus have the
same endings: masculine and neuter a-stems (such as प्रियः बालः ‘the dear boy’, प्रियं मित्रम् ‘the dear friend’)
and feminine ā-stems (such as प्रिया कन्या ‘the dear girl’). Now that we have feminine nouns and adjectives from different declensions, we may find forms that agree (i.e. stand in the same case, number and
gender) but nevertheless employ formally different endings (such as प्रिया नारी ‘the dear woman’ (Nom)
or प्रिये नारि ‘dear woman!’ (Voc)). The more declensions we encounter, the more different endings for
one and the same form (Dat Sg, Nom Du, etc.) we will see. Do not let this confuse you.
13
128
VISARGA SANDHI
As mentioned, original word-final -s appears as visarga -ḥ when no other word follows. The same is
the case with original -r (and thus पुनर् ‘again’ appears as पुनः – but see below on ‘Original Final -r’).
The sandhi of visarga is slightly more complicated than that of other word-final sounds: having several
sources, visarga can change into several sounds, and how it changes depends not only on the sound
that follows, but also on the vowel that precedes (there being three categories: a, ā, or any other). This
is best illustrated in the following table:
Visarga Sandhi

Note:
– Visarga behaves like word-final stops in that it changes in one way in front of voiced sounds, and
in another way in front of unvoiced sounds.
– It is only in the behaviour in front of voiced sounds (shaded fields) in which it matters what
vowel precedes.
– In front of unvoiced stops that have a corresponding sibilant (palatal c(h) and ś, retroflex ṭ(h)
and ṣ, dental t(h) and s) visarga appears as this sibilant.
1
Final -aḥ turns into -a in front of a vowel, with the exception of short a-: in front of that, -aḥ
changes into -o, and the following initial a- is dropped, i.e. is not pronounced any more. To indicate
that an a- had once been in that position (and thus to keep words recognisable), Sanskrit writing
makes use of ऽ, the avagraha, a symbol that is not pronounced, but used only to show where an
initial a- had once been:
नरः अपगच्छति –› नरो ऽपगच्छति ‘The man goes away.’
In transliteration, the avagraha is represented by an apostrophe ’: naro ’pagacchati.
2
When visarga stands in front of an initial r-, it drops out. If the preceding vowel is short, it becomes lengthened.
राज्ञीं सेना ज्ञीं भिः रक्षति –› राज्ञीं सेनाभी र ज्ञीं क्षति ‘He protects the queen with his armies.’
Original Final -r
Visarga that results from underlying final -r remains as -r in front of voiced sounds, independently
of what vowel it is preceded by. Thus we get e.g. नरः अत्र –› नरो ऽत्र ‘the man here, this man’ (sandhi
of visarga from original -s), but पुनर् अत्र –› पुनरत्र ‘here again’ (sandhi of visarga from original -r).
In front of initial r-, it drops out, and if it is preceded by a short vowel, that vowel lengthens पुनर्
रक्षति –› पुना रक्षति ‘He protects again.’
So that we may recognise them, this book lists words containing an original final -r
with that -r (rather than with the -ḥ it turns to through external sandhi); thus e.g. पुनर्
(Chapter 3 Vocabulary) rather than पुनः.

‘again and again’, श्वः श्वः means ‘tomorrow and the tomorrow after that; on many days from now on’,
युगे युगे ‘from age to age, throughout the ages’, अन्यो ऽन्यः ‘another and yet another’, पूजां पूजां करोति ‘he
makes worship and worship’, i.e. ‘he worships again and again/continuously’, and so on.

CHAPTER 14
Compound Nouns
This chapter gives a detailed introduction to the main types of Sanskrit compound – hence its
length. No memorisation of new forms is required, however, and simply reading through this material and using it for future reference should be sufficient.
GENERAL
A compound noun is a noun that consists of more than one stem. English examples include words
such as toothpaste (consisting of tooth and paste), underworld, ruby-red, tree house or chewing gum.
(Compounds in English are often not written as one word, but hyphenated or written as two separate words, while Sanskrit compounds are always written as one word. In what follows, some
Sanskrit compounds will also be broken up by hyphens, yet that is solely to help you understand
their structure.)
Compound nouns (or ‘compounds’) in Sanskrit basically function like compounds in English. Yet
there is a crucial difference: in English, compounds usually refer to something more specific than
just the sum of their parts. A blackboard, for example, is not just any board that is black, but a specific kind of flat surface on which to write with chalk. Sanskrit compounds, on the other hand, are
often made up on the spot: a kind person can simply be called a kindperson, प्रिय-जन- (made up of
प्रिय- ‘dear’ and जन- ‘person’); a message from Rāma may simply be a Rāma-message, राम-वचन-
(राम- ‘Rāma’, वचन- ‘word; message’); and so on. As a result, compounds are very frequent in Sanskrit.
This chapter will describe the main types of Sanskrit compound. These ‘types’ are distinguished on
the basis of the relation that the compound parts (or ‘members’) have to one another. Compare, for
example, the English compounds blackbird and toothbrush: a blackbird is thus called because it is
black; but a toothbrush is not a brush that is a tooth. Rather, it is a brush that is intended for one’s
teeth. The ‘types’ we distinguish go back to categories established by the ancient Indian grammarians. While they named several types by using an actual compound of that type (toothbrush would
be a tatpuruṣa compound; see below), Western scholars use more descriptive/analytical terminology (a tatpuruṣa is called a ‘dependent determinative’). Both sets of terminology are commonly
used and will thus be given and explained here.
14
138
STEMS
One last general point: of the members of a compound, it is typically just the final one that has a
case ending. The others appear in their stem form. Take the compound अश्व-कोविदः (lit.) ‘horseskilled’, i.e. ‘skilled with horses’: used as independent words, Sanskrit would say either अश्वानां कोविदः
‘skilled/knowledgeable of horses’ or अश्षु को वे विदः ‘skilled in (respect to) horses’; in both phrases,
अश्व- would require a case ending. Used in a compound, only its stem appears, and we need to infer
from the context what function it has in this particular instance.
The exceptions to this rule are āmreḍita and a subtype of tatpuruṣa compounds (see below).
This is also the case in English, but there it is much less noticeable: given that English
nouns hardly have any case endings, the stem and the ‘full’ form of a noun are mostly
identical. Yet note that we talk of a swordfight, not a +
swordsfight, even though certainly
two or several swords are involved; although a bookseller hopefully sells more than one
book in their career, this does not make them a +
books-seller; and toothpaste is a paste for
many teeth. The reason for the apparent singular of sword, book and tooth is that they are
not actually singular, but represent the stem of each noun (which happens to be identical
to the singular form of the noun).
TYPES OF SANSKRIT COMPOUND NOUNS
1) Karmadhāraya and Tatpuruṣa
These two types are very similar and are thus best discussed together. In Western terminology, they
are referred to as determinative compounds. This name describes what they do: the first member
gives details about or ‘determines’ the meaning of the second. To re-use some of the English examples
given above, a tree house refers to a particular kind of house, namely one in a tree; a swordfight is a
particular kind of fight, namely one fought with swords; and a blackbird is a (specific) bird that is black.
We distinguish two types of determinative compound. This distinction is based on the way in
which the first member ‘determines’ the second. In a karmadhāraya or descriptive determinative,
the first element describes the second: a blackbird is a bird that is black; a whiteboard is a board that
is white; ruby-red is a red like a ruby/like the red of a ruby. If we expressed these concepts by means
of independent words, then e.g. white and board would stand in the same case; the adjective ‘white’
would agree with the noun ‘board’ that it modifies.
If there is any other kind of case relation, the compound is a tatpuruṣa. A tree house is not a +
‘house
that is a tree’; it is a house that is in a tree: there is a locative relation between the head noun ‘house’
and the noun that describes it, ‘tree’. A gunfight is not +
‘a fight that is a gun’, but a fight with guns:
14
139
here, we have an instrumental relationship; a cookbook is a book for cooks/for cooking (dative); a
riverbank is the bank of a river (genitive); sightseeing means seeing the sights (accusative); and so
on. Any determinative compound ‘XY’ that cannot be understood as an ‘X that is (like a) Y’ is
called a tatpuruṣa or dependent determinative: taking the compound apart into its members, the
first member does not describe the second (as it would in blackbird –› a black bird), but rather is
grammatically dependent on it (tree house –› a house in a tree).
Sometimes, tatpuruṣa compounds do actually include the case ending of their first member; e.g.
दास्याः-पुत्र- ‘son of a female slave (दासी-, Gen दास्याः). These compounds are called aluksamāsa.
When the first member in a dependent determinative will include a case ending and when it will
not cannot be predicted; some simply do.
On tatpuruṣa compounds whose last member is a verbal root –› Chapter 15.
Some Sanskrit Examples
Karmadhārayas: महा-राज- ‘a king who is great’ –› ‘great king, maharaja’ (महा- ‘great’, राज- ‘king’);
राज-ऋषि- ‘a king-seer’, a king-like/royal seer (राज- ‘king’, ऋषि- ‘seer, sage’); प्रिय-सख- ‘dear-friend’
(प्रिय- ‘dear’, सख- ‘friend’); मेघ-श्याम- ‘a black like a cloud(’s)’ –› ‘black as a cloud’ (मेघ- ‘cloud’, श्याम-
‘dark, black’); पुरुष-व्याघ्र- ‘man-tiger’ (पुरुष- ‘man’ व्याघ्र- ‘tiger’) –› ‘a tiger among men, a man like a
tiger’, i.e. ‘a very fast/strong man’; मेघ-दूत- ‘cloud-messenger’ (मेघ- ‘cloud’ दूत- ‘messenger’) –› ‘a messenger who is a cloud’ (title of a poem by Kālidāsa).
Tatpuruṣas:देव-पति- ‘chief god, lord of the gods’ (देव- ‘god’, पति- ‘master, lord’); सखी-गण- ‘group (गण-) of
girlfriends (सखी-)’; अश्व-कोविद- ‘horse-knowing’ –› ‘knowledgeable about horses’ (कोविद- ‘knowledgeable’); वेद-विद-् ‘Veda-knowing’ (√विद ‘to know’). ् Aluksamāsas: परं-तप- ‘enemy-burner, enemy-killer’
(परं-Acc Sg of पर- ‘enemy, other’, तप- ‘burning’); युधि-ष्ठिर- ‘in-battle-steady’ –› ‘steadfast in battle’ (युधि-
Loc Sg of युध्- ‘battle’, स्थिर- ‘solid, firm’ (with s –› ṣ according to ruki)).
As mentioned above, the names of at least some Sanskrit compound types exemplify
that type. Tatpuruṣa means ‘servant of him, his servant’ (tat- is the stem of the masculine
pronoun ‘he, this one’ (–› Chapter 20)). The term karmadhāraya, on the other hand,
appears only as a name for this particular type of compound. Its meaning and the reason
why it was chosen are unclear. Aluksamāsa means ‘compound (samāsa) that does not (a-)
have luk (the technical term for the absence of case endings as we find it in compounds)’.
2) Bahuvrīhi
When we look at the determinative compounds above, we can see that they are always nouns
if their last member is a noun (tree house, blackbird), and adjectives if their final member is an
14
140
adjective (hand-made, ice-cold, ruby-red). Yet bahuvrīhis, referred to as ‘possessive’ compounds
in Western terms, are always adjectives, even though their final member is a noun. Compare the
English bahuvrīhi barefoot: this does not refer to +
a foot (noun!) that is bare, but is an adjective
describing someone whose feet are bare. The same holds for terms such as lightweight (lightweight
clothing is clothing whose weight is light), king-size (not ‘a size that is a king’, but rather something
whose size is a king’s, befitting a king), and so on. In English, many bahuvrīhis are formed with
the suffix -ed: a person may be barefoot, but they will be brown-eyed and long-haired rather than
+
brown-eye and +
long-hair.
Bahuvrīhis work the same way in English as in Sanskrit; yet in Sanskrit, they are once again far
more frequent and varied. While in English, the first member is usually an adjective, Sanskrit uses
more or less any kind of word in this position: adjectives (including participles), nouns, prepositions/preverbs, numerals. Compare the following examples, all employing मुख- (n.) ‘mouth, face’
as their second member:
Bahuvrīhi compounds
1st Member Example Meaning
Adjective महा-मुख- ‘big-mouthed’, someone whose mouth is big
Participle नत-मुख- ‘bent-faced’, someone whose face is bent down, i.e.
who is looking down
Noun अश्व-मुख- ‘horse-faced’, someone whose face is a horse’s/horselike
Preposition/Preverb प्रति-मुख- ‘towards-faced’, i.e. someone whose face is (turned)
towards something –› simply ‘facing’
Numeral चतुर्-मुख- ‘four-faced’, someone whose faces are four/who has
four faces (the god Brahmā)
Other अ-मुख- ‘un-mouthed’, something ‘whose mouth is not’, i.e.
which has no mouth, is mouthless
These examples show several things:
If an idea can be expressed as a bahuvrīhi, Sanskrit often actually does express it as such. Compare such words as एक-पूर्व- ‘whose previous (पूर्व-) is one (एक-)’ (used in the feminine एक-पूर्वा
to describe a woman who has been married once before), आ-जानु-बाहु- ‘to (आ-) – knee (जानु-) –
arm (बाहु-)’ –› ‘whose arms are (i.e. reach) to his knees’, or हत-पुत्र- ‘killed-sonned, whose sons
14
141
(पुत्र-) have been killed (हत-)’. Bahuvrīhis whose first member is a ta-participle (हत- ‘killed’, जित-
‘defeated’, गत- ‘gone’ etc.) are particularly frequent.
The basic translation of a bahuvrīhi XY is usually ‘someone/something whose Y is (like) X’. Use this
as a starting-point; yet the basic translation is rarely idiomatic in English, and translations such as
‘someone who has an X that is (like) Y’ or ‘someone X-Y-ed’ (e.g. brown-eyed) may be more suitable.
Sometimes, we also get an instrumental relation: जित-क्लम- is not just someone whose fatigue (क्लम-)
is overcome/defeated (जित-), but more specifically ‘someone by whom fatigue has been overcome’.
Often, individual and free translations into English are best (e.g. प्रति-मुख- is ‘turned towards,
facing’, not +
‘(someone) whose face is towards’); translate passive participles actively (e.g. जितक्लम- ‘who has overcome his fatigue’).
The fact that bahuvrīhis are always adjectives helps in recognising them. While nouns have one
fixed gender, adjectives agree in gender with the noun they describe. The noun मुख- ‘mouth, face’
is neuter; yet if we find a form such as masculine अश्व-मुखः (as in, for example, अश्वमुखः नरः ‘a horsefaced man’) we know we must be dealing with an adjective, and the only way for a compound
ending in a noun to be an adjective is if it is a bahuvrīhi. (We do, of course, also find bahuvrīhis that
happen to be of the same gender as their final member.)
The term bahuvrīhi literally means ‘much-rice(d), whose rice is much, having much rice’
and is originally used to describe fertile land; later it comes to be used in the broader
sense of ‘rich’. In English, these are called possessive compounds, even though they do not
strictly speaking denote the act of possessing or owning something.
3) Dvandva
Dvandvas, or coordinative compounds, combine members that would otherwise be linked with
‘and’: instead of saying सूर्यः चन्द्रः च ‘sun and moon’, Sanskrit can say सूर्य-चन्द्रौ ‘sun-moon’ (notice
the dual ending of this word, indicating that this one compound refers to two things); instead of
speaking of पुत्राः पौत्राः च ‘children and grandchildren’, Sanskrit can simply say पुत्र-पौत्राः.
Whenever a dvandva refers to exactly two people or things, it stands in the dual (–› सूर्य-चन्द्रौ);
whenever it refers to more than two, it has a plural ending. Yet note that, in such cases, we have to
infer from the context how many people or things are actually talked about: looking at पुत्र-पौत्राः,
only context can tell us whether we are dealing with one child and several grandchildren, several
children and one grandchild, or several children and several grandchildren.
Originally, Sanskrit (or rather: Vedic) used dvandvas only rarely, and only of ‘natural’ pairs, e.g. for
gods or natural phenomena prayed to together (such as ‘Indra and Viṣṇu’ or ‘Heaven and Earth’).
14
142
Yet by the time of Epic and Classical Sanskrit, dvandvas can have more than two members (such as
देव-गन्धर्व-मानुष-उरग-राक्षसान् ‘gods, divine spirits, men, snakes and demons’, Mahābhārata 3.50.28),
and can contain a list of words that just happen to be mentioned together (as in धन-धान्य-आयुधउदकै ः ‘with money, grain, weapons and water’, Mahābhārata 2.94.44). (Note again that these are
normally written without hyphens, but as one continuous word. The hyphens are used here only to
clarify the structure of the compound.)
The term dvandva (Sanskrit द्वंद्वम्, which is द्वम् + द्वम् ‘two-two’) means ‘pair’.
Dvandvas exist in English, but work slightly differently. Singer-songwriter does not refer
to two people – a singer and a songwriter – but one person who is both things, a singer
and a songwriter. A city-state is a political entity that is both a city and an independent
state. Dvandva adjectives (which are rare in Sanskrit) also describe one thing that has two
qualities; take e.g. English bitter-sweet or tragicomic. We also find dvandva nouns used
adjectivally in larger compounds: orange-mango juice is juice consisting of both oranges
and mangoes.
Two less frequent compound types: āmreḍita (lit. ‘repeated’) or iterative compounds repeat an
inflected word form to imply a repetition of the idea conveyed by the word: e.g. दिवे-दिवे (दिवेLoc
Sg of दिव- ‘day’) ‘day by day, daily’, युगे-युगे (युगेLoc Sg of युग- ‘age’) ‘from age to age, in every age’.
Avyayībhāva (lit. ‘indeclinable’) compounds consist of an indeclinable first member (e.g. an adverb or a preverb) and a second member in its (Ntr) Acc Sg form, signifying that this compound
is used as an adverb (–› Chapter 9 on adverb formation). Thus, we get e.g. यथा-आगतम् ‘as-come’ (as
in ‘they left as they had come’) or सम्-अक्षम् ‘in sight’ (lit. ‘with-eyed’: अक्ष- ‘eye’).
ANALYSING COMPOUNDS
1) General
The meaning of the members of a compound usually allows us to understand the compound as a
whole. Even without conscious reflection, we see that English hand-made means ‘made by hand’,
but home-made means ‘made at home’. From the meaning and connotations of the words involved,
we may assume that a राज-पुत्री (the feminine form of राज-पुत्रः ‘king-son’ –› ‘prince’) is the daughter
of a king (tatpuruṣa). Still, a compound such as राज-पुत्रः could be either a tatpuruṣa (son of a king)
or a bahuvrīhi (whose son is a king). Wherever the compound in itself is (potentially) ambiguous,
the context will allow us to understand its meaning.
In Vedic, different accent placements provided an unambiguous formal identification of
at least some types of compound.
14
143
Wherever the meaning of a compound has become specialised in some way and we can thus not
infer its meaning from its members or its context, a dictionary will list it specifically.
2) Longer Compounds
Compounds with more than two members are relatively frequent in Sanskrit (and very frequent
in genres such as kāvya/court poetry). Yet all of these just belong to the types just outlined and
can almost always be split up into compounds consisting of two members, with one member itself
being a compound. A few examples from Book I of the Bhagavad-Gītā:
उत्सन्न-कु ल-धर्मः a tatpuruṣa (कु ल-धर्म- ‘law(s) of the family’) within a bahuvrīhi (‘one
whose [family laws] are destroyed’): [ उत्सन्न-[कु ल-धर्मः]]
राज्य-सुख-लोभः a karmadhāraya (राज्य-सुख- ‘royal happiness’) within a tatpuruṣa
(‘greed for [royal happiness]’): [[ राज्य-सुख-]लोभः]
जन्म-बन्ध-विनिर्मुक्त: a tatpuruṣa (जन्म-बन्ध- ‘the bondage of (re)birth’) within a tatpuruṣa
(‘freed from [the bondage of (re)birth]’): [[ जन्म-बन्ध-]विनिर्मुक्त:]
A longer example from the Recognition of Śakuntalā, a play by the Classical Sanskrit poet Kālidāsa,
describing a deer that has been chased:
श्रम-वितत-मुख-भ्रंशी a tatpuruṣa (‘open from exhaustion’) within a karmadhāraya (a mouth
(that is) [open from exhaustion]) within another tatpuruṣa (‘falling
from [a mouth open from exhaustion]]’): [[[श्रम-वितत]-मुख-]भ्रंशी]
But compare also a multi-member dvandva from the Āryāsaptaśatī:
उद्गमन- उपनिवेशन- शयन- परावृत्ति- वलन- चलनेषु
getting up- sitting down- sleeping- turning around-turning back- walkingLocPl
(‘Whether I get up, sit down, lie on my bed, turn around, twist my body, or walk about
(lit.: ‘in getting ups, sitting downs (…) and walkings’), like asthma that affects the heart,
my lover makes me dizzy all the time.’)
In longer compounds even more than in short ones, ambiguity is not infrequent (and may be
intentional), and we rely on the context or also the analyses of ancient textual commentators to tell
us what a compound means in a specific instance.

THE NUTSHELL: THE MAIN TYPES OF SANSKRIT COMPOUNDS
Sanskrit name Western name Sanskrit example English example
Tatpuruṣa Dependent determinative मही-पतिः ‘earth-ruler, lord
of the earth’
gunfight,
tree house
Karmadhāraya Descriptive determinative:
‘a Y that is X/like X’
महा-राजः ‘great king,
maharaja’
blackbird
Bahuvrīhi Possessive:
‘whose Y is X’
महा-मुखः (-मुखा (f.), मुखम्
(n.)) ‘whose mouth is
great, great-mouthed’
barefoot
Dvandva Co-ordinative: ‘X and Y’ सूर्य-चन्द्रौ ‘sun and moon’ (bitter-sweet)
Notes:
– Only the last compound member regularly has a case ending; with some exceptions
(aluksamāsa, āmreḍita), all other members appear in their stem form.
– What type a compound belongs to and what its exact meaning is needs to be inferred from
its context.
– Compounds in Sanskrit are far more frequent and varied than in English; their meaning
does not have to go beyond the sum of their parts.
– Remember that bahuvrīhis are always adjectives. This helps recognise them.
FORMAL NOTE: STEM CHANGES
Sanskrit words may change their form when used in a compound: used on their own, the two
words in महा-राज- (m.) ‘great king’, for example, are महत्- (nt-stem) and राजन्- (an-stem). You
cannot predict whether this will happen or how exactly a word may change; yet it is only the form,
not the meaning of the word, that changes, so this should not cause any practical difficulties.

Consonant Stems I
CONSONANT-STEM ENDINGS
The noun stems we have encountered so far (a-stems, ā-stems, ī-stems, ū-stems) all ended in vowels.
Sanskrit also has nouns and adjectives with stems ending in consonants. All of these share a set of
endings:
Note:
1) The form of the nominative singular varies; see below on ‘Final consonant clusters’.
2) The form of the Ntr NomVocAcc Pl ending varies; most consonant stems follow the pattern
of (long or short) vowel + nasal + stem-final consonant + -i. Compare the single paradigms for
details.
– These endings are shared also by monosyllabic ī- and ū-stems (–› Chapter 13).
– Masculine and feminine consonant stems are formally identical.
– Neuters differ from masculines in NomVocAcc; within each number, these three cases are formally identical.

– The ending -aḥ, so far known only from the Nom Sg Masc of a-stems, here also appears in the
AblGen Sg of all genders and the NomVocAcc Pl MascFem. Know the many cases -aḥ can appear in to avoid confusion.
There are many kinds of consonant stem: dental stems (ending in -t or -d, such as मरुत- ‘wind’ or ् आपद-
्
‘fall, accident’ – see below – or more specifically in -ant/-mant/-vant –› Chapter 25), s-stems (such as
मनस्- ‘mind’ –› Chapter 24), n-stems (such as राजन्- ‘king’ or हस्तिन्- ‘elephant’ –› Chapter 29) and more
rarely palatal stems (such as वाच्- ‘voice’, see below). While they all employ the same endings, the different stem-final consonants create different patterns of internal sandhi; also, several types show stem
gradation (which will be explained in Chapter 25). Hence the various types need to be looked at individually. Dental stems display the most straightforward kind of sandhi and are thus discussed first.
Final Consonant Clusters
A brief note to explain the nominative forms we are going to see: the rules of Sanskrit do not allow
more than one consonant to stand at the end of a word. If several consonants meet in this place,
all but the first drop out. Sometimes, the last vowel of the word is lengthened ‘in compensation’
for this consonant loss: thus, the Nom Sg Masc ending e.g. of vant-stems (–› Chapter 25) is -vān.
Dental stems: मरुत्- (m.) ‘wind’; आपद-् (f.) ‘fall, accident, misfortune’; जगत्- (n.) ‘world’
(For tables listing each paradigm individually, see pp. 395 in the Appendices.)

Note:
– Feminine and masculine dental stems are formally identical.
– Dental-stem neuters differ from the masculine/feminine paradigm in their NomVocAcc; within
each number, NomVocAcc are identical to one another.
– Note the NomVocAcc Ntr Pl: the nasal (-n-) and the final short -i also appear in a-stem neuters
(-āni).
The following internal sandhi occurs:
– the stem-final sounds remain unchanged before vowels, e.g. Instr Sg मरुता, आपदा
– they become or remain voiced before voiced consonants, e.g. Instr Pl मरुद्भिः, आपद्भिः
– they become or remain voiceless before voiceless consonants: Loc Pl मरुत्, सुआपत्सु
and in final position: Nom Sg मरुत, ्आपत्
PALATAL STEMS
Palatal stems: वाच्- (f.) ‘voice’; यज्ञभुज्- ‘enjoying the sacrifice’ (here given in m. and n.)
(√भुज्‘to enjoy’ (Class VII) will be introduced in Chapter 18)

For the most part, the formal notes applying to palatal stems are the same as those for the dental
stems above. Yet one additional change through internal sandhi needs to be pointed out: before
any consonant, whether voiceless or voiced, as well as in final position, palatals are replaced by
their corresponding velars (c –› k; j –› g). Loss, retention or assumption of voicing is the same as in
dental stems (no voicing in word-final position or before voiceless consonants, but always before
voiced consonants).
15
153
VERB-FINAL TATPURUṢAS
A considerable number of such dental and palatal stems are tatpuruṣas whose second member is a
verbal root. Many verbal roots end in a consonant, which then becomes the stem-final consonant
of the compound. Compare:
यज्ञ-भुज्- ‘enjoying the sacrifice’    वेद-विद-् ‘knowing the Vedas’*
Verbal roots that end in a vowel other than -a or -ā often add -t, thus creating compound stems
that are easy to decline:
-ji-t- in युद्ध-जित्- ‘victorious in battle’  -śru-t- in सु-श्रुत्- ‘hearing well’*
-kṛ-t- in सुख-कृत्- ‘making/causing happiness’*
Verbal roots that end in -a (as e.g. √गम् in its zero grade gm –› ga) or -ā (as e.g. √स्था) are used in
compounds with a final short -a, thus joining the common group of a-stems. (If original -ā was
retained, the resulting forms all would look like feminines.) Other roots may be strengthened to
guṇa and add an -a, thus also appearing as a-stems:
ख-ग- ‘sky-goer’, i.e. ‘bird’ रथ-स्थ- ‘standing on a chariot’
बल-कर- ‘strength-making, strengthening’ (from √कृ ‘to make, do’)*
*The verbs √भुज् ‘to enjoy’, √विद ‘to know’,
् √श् ‘to listen’ and रु √कृ ‘to make, do’ will be introduced
properly in Chapter 18.
STYLISTIC NOTE: THE USE OF स- IN COMPOUNDS
स- (related to the preverb सम्- and to the postposition सह ‘with’) may be prefixed to a noun, resulting in a bahuvrīhi adjective: e.g. सपुत्र- ‘with-childrened, having children’. This kind of adjective
may be used in two ways:
– Agreeing with another noun in expressions that are best translated into English as ‘A and B’: नृपः
सभार्यः पुरं गच्छति ‘the king and his wife go to the city’ (lit. ‘the king, with-wived, goes to the city’)
– In the Acc Sg Ntr as an adverb: सक्रोधम् ‘angrily’ (lit. ‘with-anger-ly’).

Unfounded and deluded on brahman’s path,
doesn’t he lose both worlds and perish like a

dispel this doubt of mine completely, Kṛṣṇa,
for there is no one else who can remove it.’

world nor in the other; for no one who does
good deeds treads the path of misfortune,
my friend. He who falls from yoga attains the

reunited with the understanding he had in
his earlier body, and so strives once again
for perfection, delight of the Kurus; he is
carried along by his former habits whether
he likes it or not. Even someone who merely
aspires to know yoga transcends the brahman of the Vedic world; so the yogī strives
with great effort, cleans away his impurities,
perfects himself through many births, and
then reaches his final destination. The yogī
surpasses the ascetics, and all the men of
knowledge, and those who perform ritual
actions; so become a yogī, Arjuna! And the
most accomplished yogī of all, in my view,
is the faithful one who honours me with his
inner self merged in me.’

CHAPTER 16
Sandhi III: Vowel Sandhi
A vowel at the end of a word interacts (and often merges) with a following vowel, but
remains the same when a consonant follows.
The simplest kind of sandhi occurs in the combination of a word-final vowel followed by a wordinitial consonant: here, nothing happens.
Yet when a word-final vowel is followed by a word-initial vowel, they often link up and eradicate
any gap between them; thus they are also combined in writing. This process takes one of two
possible shapes. When two identical vowels (whether long or short) meet, they merge into one
long vowel:
a or ā + a or ā –› ā
i or ī + i or ī –› ī
u or ū + u or ū –› ū
ṛ or ṝ + ṛ or ṝ –› ṝ
सेना आगच्छति –› सेनागच्छति ‘The army is coming.’
कन्या गच्छति इति वदति –› कन्या गच्छतीति वदति ‘“The girl is going”, he says.’
When final -a/-ā encounters a different vowel, a/ā + i/ī gives e (<*ai), a/ā + e (<*ai) gives ai (<*āi),
and so on. (On e < *ai etc. –› Chapter 2.)
सेना तत्र इति वदति –› सेना तत्रेति वदति ‘There (is) the army’, he says.
When final -i/-ī, -u/-ū or -ṛ/-ṝ encounter a different vowel, they turn into their non-vocalic (glide)
form (-y, -v and -r, respectively; –› Chapter 2 on semivowels/glides) and are thus combined in
writing with whatever follows:
इति उक्त्वा –› इत्युक्त्वा ‘having spoken thus’
VOWEL SANDHI
16
161
The same applies to the -u at the end of final -au (remember that au originally was *āu; before
another vowel, it thus appears as -āv, not as +
-av):
कु मारौ आगच्छतः –› कु मारावागच्छतः ‘The two young men are coming.’
The other complex vowels, however, display different behaviour: remembering that underlying
e, ai and o are *ai, *āi and *au, we might expect the final i and u to turn into y and v, respectively,
as they do elsewhere. Instead, these final sounds are simply lost, leaving a gap between the two
words in question:
वने आश्रमः अभवत् –› वन आश्रमो ऽभवत ‘In the forest, there was a hermitage.’ ्
The one exception to this: after final -e and -o, initial a- drops out, and -e and -o remain unchanged.
To avoid confusion, the former presence of a- is marked with the avagraha ऽ. (In the table below, as
well as in transliterated texts in general, the avagraha is indicated with an apostrophe ’.)
वने अतिष्ठत् –› वने ऽतिष्ठत ‘He stood in the forest.’ ्
All possible forms of external vowel sandhi are represented in the following table.
F i n a l v o w e l s

vowels that behave differently in external from how they do in internal sandhi.
16
162
An Exception to Vowel Sandhi
A small number of ‘uncombinable’ final vowels in specific words and word forms do not merge
with the following initial vowels. These are the long -ī, -ū and -e of NomVocAcc dual endings, the
Nom Pl Mascअमी (from अदस् –› Chapter 39) and the final vowels of interjections such as ā, he, aho
‘ah!, oh!’. (These vowels are called pragṛhya, lit. ‘to be taken on their own’.)
You will be pleased to know that you have now been introduced to all variants of external
sandhi.
INTERNAL VS. EXTERNAL SANDHI: A COMPARISON
Internal and external sandhi function according to the same basic principles: both achieve
easier pronunciation of words and sentences. External sandhi applies between independent
words, while internal sandhi applies within words (e.g. when a suffix such as -ta- or -tvā is
added to a verbal root, or a case ending to a noun stem). The details of external sandhi have
been introduced in Chapters 11, 13 and 16. Those instances where internal sandhi differs from
external sandhi have been discussed where they were first encountered, and a list of them is
given in the Reference Grammar (in Appendix III). The main features exclusive to internal
consonant sandhi are buddha sandhi, the ruki rule and the retroflexion of n; the main difference
between external and internal vowel sandhi lies in the treatment of e, o and ai before another
vowel (internal: e –› ay, o –› av, ai –› āy; external: e –› a, o –› a (except before a-, where both
remain as they are), ai –› ā).
STYLISTIC NOTE: MEN LIKE TIGERS
In Sanskrit literature, the strength of a warrior is often expressed by reference to strong animals,
especially bulls and tigers. These vivid comparisons include पुरुष-व्याघ्र-, पुरुष-शार्दूल- and मनुजव्याघ्र-, all meaning ‘man-tiger’, i.e. ‘a tiger among men, a man like a tiger’ and thus ‘an extremely
strong man’, or पुरुष-ऋषभ- and पुरुष-पुंगव- ‘man-bull’. In the Mahābhārata, we find different warriors addressed or referred to as e.g. भरत-ऋषभ- ‘Bharata bull, bull-like Bharata, bull among the
Bharatas’ or भरत-शार्दूल- ‘Bharata tiger, tiger-like Bharata, strongest/fastest of the Bharatas’. (As
before, the hyphens in these compounds are inserted only for clarification; they are not used in
the Sanskrit.)

‘I do not wish to obstruct you. I am
not one to put obstacles in your way.
Listen to something, Rāma. Once you
have heard it, do what you have to. If,
at your command, I give you a path for
your marching army, others too will
command me in the same way, by force
of bow. But there is a powerful monkey
here called Nala; respected by artisans,
he is the son of the builder god Viśvakarman. What he throws into me –
wood, grass, or stone – all that I shall
support. That will be your causeway.’
Saying this, he disappeared. Rāma said
to Nala: ‘Build a bridge over the sea, for
I believe you can do it.’ By this means,
Kakutstha had a causeway built, ten
yojanas wide, a hundred yojanas long,
which, even today, is known as Nala’s
causeway, famed on earth, looking like
a mountain, and procured at Rāma’s
command.’

CHAPTER 17
Noun Formation
THE SUFFIXES -A-, -ANA-, -TRA-, -TVA- AND -TĀThe process of noun formation (or ‘derivation’) involves forming nouns from the basis of other
words or word forms; cf. English entertainer and entertainment from the verb entertain. In Sanskrit, noun formation usually involves adding a suffix to either a verbal root (which can stand in
any of the three vowel grades, yet guṇa is the most common) or another noun (whose first vowel
may be put into its vṛddhi grade). Knowledge of these processes will help you recognise many more
Sanskrit words than you memorise, and thus improve your reading skills. This chapter focuses on
nouns and adjectives formed by means of adding the most frequent a- and ā-stem suffixes.
A very simple way of forming nouns and adjectives from a verbal root is to take that root in guṇa
(sometimes also vṛddhi ā) and add -a- to it. This gives us words such as लेख- (m.) ‘a writing, letter’
from √लिख् ‘to write’, वेद- (m.) ‘knowledge’ from √विद ‘to see, know’ ( ् Chapter 18). स्ह-ने means
‘love’; बोध- (m.) means ‘waking, consciousness’, while, used as an adjective, it means ‘knowing,
understanding’; हर्ष- used as a masculine noun means ‘excitement’ and, as an adjective, ‘exciting’;
हर- and हार- both mean ‘bearing, wearing, carrying’ etc. Nouns derived in this way are frequently
masculine, but may also be neuter.
-ana- is another suffix added to verbal roots in guṇa. It forms adjectives and nouns similarly to
English -ing: from √मुच् ‘to release, free’, we get the adjective मोचन- ‘releasing, freeing’, which is
also used in the neuter as a noun meaning ‘(the act of) releasing, release’. From √वच् ‘to speak’ we
find the frequently used noun वचन- ‘(act of) speaking; word, speech’ and an adjective that simply
means ‘talking, speaking’. √शुभ् ‘to decorate, adorn; adorn oneself ’ gives us the adjective शोभन-
‘pleasing, pleasant, beautiful’. Yet it also forms concrete nouns: the noun लोचन-, derived from √लोच्
‘to see’, means ‘eye’. When used as nouns, ana-formations are practically always neuter. ana-adjectives are usually found as the final member of a compound.
A very specific and predictable meaning is achieved by adding -tra- to verbal roots in guṇa: the
result is an instrument noun, i.e. a noun that denotes instruments for carrying out the verbal action in question. √शास् means ‘to command, instruct, teach’; accordingly a शास्त्र- is an instrument
for instructing, a precept, command, a textbook. √शस् means ‘to cut’, and so शस्त्र- refers to any
17
173
instrument for cutting or wounding: a ‘knife’, ‘sword’, ‘dagger’ etc. From √मन् ‘to think’, we get मन्त्र-,
which literally is an ‘instrument for thinking’, and is commonly used to mean ‘prayer, incantation’.
नेत्र- ‘eye’ literally is the instrument that leads (√नी); पत्त्र- ‘wing’ is the instrument for flying (√पत ); ्
and so on. -tra-formations are for the most part neuter.
-tva- is added not to verbal roots but to nouns and adjectives, and is loosely equivalent to the English suffixes -ness, -dom or -hood, as in brotherhood, childhood etc., denoting ‘the state of being x’.
Thus नरत्व- means ‘being a नर-, manhood, humanity’; देवत्व- is ‘divinity’, the state of being a god
(but can refer to a specific entity, just as English deity does). ‘Being a teacher’, गुरु-, is गुरुत्व-, and
so on. tva-derivatives from adjectives are best translated into English with the suffix -ness, as in
अबुद्धत्व- ‘foolishness’ from अबुद्ध- ‘foolish’. -tva-formations are neuter.
Very similar to -tva- in its use and meaning is the suffix -tā-. It is added to adjectives and nouns
to form abstracts; some nouns use both -tva- and -tā-. Thus we find e.g. प्रियता- ‘dearness, being
dear’, मर्त्यता- ‘mortality’, मित्रता- ‘friendship’, पुरुषता- ‘manhood, manliness’, देवता- once again with a
double meaning of ‘divinity; deity, god’, and so on. -tā- abstracts are feminine.
VṚDDHI DERIVATIVES
Nouns and adjectives can be derived from other nouns by putting the first vowel of the word into
vṛddhi. These ‘vṛddhi derivatives’ have the meaning of ‘belonging to (the basic noun)’. Thus from
पुर- ‘city’ we get पौर- (m.) ‘someone belonging to a city’, i.e. a citizen. If the basic word is not an
a-stem, it is frequently turned into one; already existing final -a may be replaced by -ya-: one term
for ‘doctor’ is वैद्य- (m.), i.e. someone who ‘belongs to’, or is well versed in, वेद- ‘knowledge’. सेना-
means ‘army’, and one who belongs to the army, i.e. a soldier, accordingly is a सैन्य- (m.). शौर्य- (n.)
‘heroism, valour’ belongs to a शूर- ‘hero, strong man’, and on the basis of मित्र- ‘friend’ we get several
nouns for ‘friendship’, among them मैत्र- (n.), मैत्र्य- (n.) and the feminine मैत्री-. (Note that these all
have the same meaning in spite of their formal differences.)
Vṛddhi derivatives of place names denote inhabitants of these places. In e.g. the story of Nala and
Damayantī, a famous part of the Mahābhārata epic, Nala is often referred to as नैषधः ‘from Niṣadha,
belonging to Niṣadha’, which was his kingdom. Damayantī, on the other hand, is from Vidarbha,
which gives her the name वैदर्भी (f.). Personal names can also be used as the basis for vṛddhi derivatives, which then denote ‘child(ren) of ’ or ‘descendant(s) of ’: the opposing sides in the Mahābhārata
are the sons of Kuru and the sons of Pāṇḍu, i.e. the कौरवाः and the पाण्डवाः. (Note that the ā in
Pāṇḍu cannot be lengthened any further, hence simply remains -ā-. Yet due to the changes at the
end of either word (including turning them into -a-stems), the derivative can still be told apart
from its basis.)
17
174
-ya- (as in e.g. मैत्र्य- above) is also used independently of vṛddhi formations, sometimes without
affecting the meaning of the basic form, but often changing nouns into adjectives, and vice versa
(e.g. अबल्य- ‘weakness’ from अबल- ‘weak’).
Practical Matters
As may have already become obvious, there is a lot of overlap between the use and meaning of the
various possible formations. When you encounter a formation using e.g. -a, -ana, -ya and/or vṛddhi
that you do not already know, you should identify the verbal root (or nominal stem) it is based on,
and then use the context to make an educated guess at what the form means – is it abstract, does it
refer to a process, or to the result of that process? If this still does not give you enough information,
look the word up in a dictionary.

CHAPTER 18
Athematic Verbs I
Athematic Verbs: Formation
The present stems of all verbs encountered so far have had one feature in common: they end in
-a. In grammatical terminology, this -a is referred to as the ‘thematic’ vowel. Compare Class I √भृ
‘to carry’ –› भर-, Class IV √हृष् ‘to be excited’ –› हृष्य-, Class VI √लिख् ‘to write’ –› लिख- and Class
X √चुर् ‘to steal’ –› चोरय-. In addition to these four classes of ‘thematic’ verbs, there are six classes
of ‘athematic’ verbs. All athematic verbs share two features: As their name suggests, their present
stems do not end in the thematic vowel -a. More noticeably:
Athematic verbs all display vowel gradation (or ablaut) of the stem.
- The strong stem, which is used in the active singular forms of present and imperfect and in
some imperatives (–› Chapter 24), stands in guṇa.
- The weak stem, which is basically used everywhere else, stands in zero grade.
These features can be seen in the following example of a Class II verb:
Root 1st Pl (weak) 1st Sg (strong)
√i i-maḥ e-mi
‘to go’ ‘we go’ ‘I go’
The 1st Pl consists of just the stem i- plus the ending -maḥ. In the 1st Sg, the ending -mi is added to
the stem e-, which is the guṇa of the root √इ.
18
181
Like thematic verbs, the various athematic verb classes differ in what is added to the root in order
to form the present tense stem:
In Class II verbs, endings are added directly to the root. No additional affixes are used.
Example: √इ ‘to go’: 1st Sg एमि ‘I go’, 1st Pl इमः ‘we go’
In Class III verbs, the root is reduplicated (see below on ‘Reduplication (Class III verbs)’). No
other affixes are added. Example: √हु ‘to sacrifice’: 1st Sg जुहोमि, 1st Pl जुहुमः
In the remaining verb classes, the root vowel itself always remains in zero grade, but in each class a
different affix is added to the root, and this affix then shows strong and weak forms:
Class V roots add the suffix -no- (strong)/-nu- (weak) after the root.
   Example: √आप् ‘to obtain, get’: 1st Sg आप्नोमि, 1st Pl आप्नुमः
The -u- of the 1st Du and Pl may be dropped in verbs whose roots do not end in a consonant. Thus:
आप्नुवः and आप्नुमः, but from √वृ ‘to cover’ वृणुवः or वृण्वः and वृणुमः or वृण्मः.
Class VII roots add strong -na-/weak -n- into the verbal root (directly before the rootfinal consonant).
   Example: √रुध् ‘to hinder’: 1st Sg रुणध्मि (on n > ṇ –› Chapter 6), 1st Pl रुन्ध्मः
Class VIII roots add strong -o-/weak -u- after the root.
   Example: √तन् ‘to stretch’: 1st Sg तनोमि, 1st Pl तनुमः
 The -u- of the 1st Du and Pl may be dropped, giving the alternatives तनुवः or तन्वः and
तनुमः or तन्मः. (As most of the few existing Class VIII roots end in -n, they effectively
look identical to Class V verbs.)
Class IX roots add the suffix -nā- in the strong forms, -nī- in weak forms whose endings
begin with a consonant, and -n- in weak forms whose endings begin with a vowel (i.e.
in the 3rd Pl).
   Example: √वृ ‘to choose’: 1st Sg वृणामि (on n > ṇ –› Chapter 6), 1st Pl वृणीमः, 3rd Pl वृणन्ति
The above contains all the general information concerning athematic verbs. The table below is
provided to give more illustrations of the principles outlined so far, and also to show the various
patterns of internal sandhi that typically occur. If the amount of new forms confuses you, start by
looking at Class V, which in many ways is the most straightforward athematic class.
18
182
Internal Sandhi in Athematic Verbs
– In the 2nd Sg, the -s- of the ending frequently changes into ṣ according to the ruki rule (–› Chapter 9). Thus, *e-si turns into एषि, *juho-si into जुहोषि, and so on.
– The -n- in the affixes in Classes V, VII and IX frequently turns into retroflex -ṇ- (–› Chapter 6
for the rule governing this): e.g. रुणध्मि or वृणामि. Remember that -n- remains unchanged when
another consonant follows immediately after; hence we find weak रुन्ध्वः etc.
– In Classes II, III and VII, which do not contain a suffix after the root, internal sandhi affects
root-final consonants in those forms whose ending begins with a stop: compare 2nd Sg रुणत्सि
or 3rd Sg रुणद्धि above. As elsewhere, before the voiceless consonants -s- and -t(h)-, aspiration is
lost, and palatals appear as velars. On buddha sandhi of voiced aspirates –› Chapter 8. Various
examples of this will be discussed in the following chapter.
– Note that in front of a vowel (i.e. in the 3rd Pl), root -final i/ī and u/ū change into y and v, respectively (–› यन्ति, जुह्वति), or into -iy-/-uv- if preceded by more than one consonant (–› आप्नुवन्ति).
A Formal Irregularity
The 3rd Pl forms add the ending -anti: as the only exception, Class III does not follow this pattern
and employs -ati instead of -anti (–› 3rd Pl जुह्वति above).
Class:
II III V VII VIII IX
√इ
‘to go’
√हु
‘to sacrifice’
√आप्

√वृ

1st एमि जुहोमि आप्नोमि वृणोमि रुणध्मि तनोमि वृणामि
Sg 2nd एषि जुहोषि आप्नोषि वृणोषि रुणत्सि तनोषि वृणासि
3rd एति जुहोति आप्नोति वृणोति रुणद्धि तनोति वृणाति
1st इवः जुहुवः आप्नुवः वृणुवः/वृण्वः रुन्ध्वः तनुवः/तन्वः वृणीवः
Du 2nd इथः जुहुथः आप्नुथः वृणुथः रुन्द्धः तनुथः वृणीथः
3rd इतः जुहुतः आप्नुतः वृणुतः रुन्द्धः तनुतः वृणीतः
1st इमः जुहुमः आप्नुमः वृणुमः/वृण्मः रुन्ध्मः तनुमः/तन्मः वृणीमः
Pl 2nd इथ जुहुथ आप्नुथ वृणुथ रुन्द्ध तनुथ वृणीथ
3rd यन्ति जुह्वति आप्नुवन्ति वृण्वन्ति रुन्धन्ति तन्वन्ति वृणन्ति

18
183
Reduplication (Class III Verbs)
Reduplicating a root means taking the first consonant and first vowel and adding them to the beginning of that root: of the root √तक् ‘to construct, fashion’, for example, the reduplicated form is ष्
त-तक्-ष्. Yet there are a few irregularities involved in this process:
a) Vowels: long vowels are reduplicated with their short counterpart: √दा ‘to give’
–› reduplicated द-दा-.
b) Consonants: aspirated consonants are reduplicated without aspiration: धा ‘to put’ –› द-धा-.
Velar consonants are reduplicated as palatals: √गुप् ‘to defend’ –› जु-गुप्-.
h, frequently representing original aspirated velar *gh, is reduplicated as j, the unaspirated palatal counterpart of gh (√हु ‘to sacrifice’ –› जु-हु-).
In consonant clusters, only the first consonant is repeated: √क्रम् ‘to stride’ –› च-क्रम्-
(with palatal instead of velar). Exception: if the cluster consists of sibilant (ś, ṣ, s) plus
stop, it is the stop that is repeated. (√स्भ् तु ‘to praise’ –› तु-ष्टुभ्- (with retroflex -ṣ- according to ruki, and -t- > -ṭ- after -ṣ-).
Reduplication also occurs in the perfect tense and even in some thematic present tense
formations (e.g. √स्था ‘to stand’ –› present ति-ष्थ-ति ‘he stands’). In both, consonants
change in the same way as in Class III verbs, but the rules for the reduplicative vowel are
different, and are discussed in the relevant chapters.
THE NUTSHELL: ATHEMATIC VERBS
Strong (guṇa): present and imperfect
singular indicative active
Weak (zero grade): all others
Nothing’s added in Class II.
Reduplicate III: juho/juhu.
In Class V add a no or a nu.
In Class VIII it’s an o or a u.
na and n are added into
Class VII. Class IX, last of the crew,
adds nā/nī/n, and that should do.
Reduplication:
– long vowels reduplicate short
– aspirates lose aspiration
– velars become palatals, h reduplicates as j
– clusters: simplified

CHAPTER 19
Athematic Verbs II
IMPERFECT
Athematic imperfect forms employ the augment and the same endings as thematic verbs in the
imperfect; yet note that the 1st Sg and 3rd Pl include an -a-:
Like athematic present forms, athematic imperfects display the strong root in the singular and
the weak root everywhere else; compare the imperfect paradigm of √हु ‘to sacrifice’ (and note the
appearance of the guṇa stem before a vowel in the 1st Sg):
Sandhi
In verbs whose stem ends in a consonant (which is possible in all classes that do not add a suffix,
i.e. II, III and VII), the 2nd and 3rd Sg may be difficult to recognise or tell apart: consonant clusters
at the end of Sanskrit words are simplified by dropping all consonants but one (just as happens in
the Nom Sg of consonant stems –› Chapter 15), and, as a consequence, both forms may be identical:
see √हन् II ‘to kill’ below or the 2nd and 3rd Sg Impf of √रुध् VII ‘to obstruct’, अरुणत (from * ् aruṇadh-s
and *aruṇadh-t). The 2nd and 3rd Sg Impf of √द्विष् ‘to hate’ is अद्वेट्. Instead of memorising a list of
forms here, it is best to remember that athematic imperfect forms whose ending is difficult to recognise are probably 2nd or 3rd Sg.

POTENTIAL
Athematic verbs do not have the potential marker -e- that we know from thematic verbs. Instead,
the suffix -yā- is added to the weak stem, giving -yām, -yāḥ etc.; but note that the 3rd Pl ending is
-yuḥ.

NOTEWORTHY PARADIGMS
Among athematic verbs, there are a number of forms that are irregular or difficult to recognise. The
following introduces the most common among them. Look over the paradigms and the brief notes
above each. Depending on what you find easier, study the paradigms or the notes.
√अस् (Class II) ‘to be’
The regular weak form of the root √अस् is s-, giving e.g. 1st Sg अस्मि, but 1st Du स्वः, 1st Pl स्मः and
3rd Pl सन्ति. This weak s- is also found throughout the potential, giving us स्याम्, स्याः, स्यात् etc.
Throughout the imperfect paradigm, we find initial ā-. Notice also the 2nd Sg असि (not *as-si) and
the unexpected -ī- in the 2nd and 3rd Sg.
√अस्(II) ‘to be’ in the present and imperfect
Present Imperfect
Sg Du Pl Sg Du Pl
अस्मि स्वः स्मः 1st आसम् आस्व आस्म
असि स्थः स्थ 2nd आसीः आस्तम् आस्त
अस्ति स्तः सन्ति 3rd आसीत् आस्ताम् आसन्
19
191
Initial ā- in the imperfect is expected in the strong forms (where augmented as- regularly
results in ās-), but unexpected in the weak forms (where the augment encounters the
initial consonant of the weak stem -sva, -stam, -stām etc.).
√इ (Class II) ‘to go’
Throughout the imperfect paradigm, the augment surfaces as ai-, the regular vṛddhi of i-. Before
vowels (i.e. the 1st-Sg ending -am and 3rd-Pl -an), the ai- (originally *āi-) takes its regular prevocalic shape āy-.
√हन् (Class II) ‘to kill’
Several forms must be noted here: the strong form of the stem, han-, is present not only
throughout the singular, but also in the 1st Du and Pl. Through a development explained in
Chapter 15 (cf. ‘Final consonant clusters’), the 2nd and 3rd Sg Impf lose their endings and both
appear as अहन्. Finally, the weak root appears as ha- before consonants, but as ghn- before
vowels (3rd Pl Pres and Impf)
Sg Du Pl
1st आयम् ऐव ऐम
2nd ऐः ऐतम् ऐत
3rd ऐत् ऐताम् आयन्
√इ (II) ‘to go’ in the imperfect
√हन्(II) ‘to kill’ in the present and imperfect
Present Imperfect
Sg Du Pl Sg Du Pl
हन्मि हन्वः हन्मः 1st अहनम् अहन्व अहन्म
हंसि हथः हथ 2nd अहन् अहतम् अहत
हन्ति हतः घ्नन्ति 3rd अहन् अहताम् अघ्नन्
The following is happening in the 3rd Pl forms: the initial h- represents original *gh-,
which regularly changed into h- before vowels. This change occurred both in guṇa
*ghan- > han- as well as in the zero grade before consonants (*ghṇtha > *ghatha > hatha).
Yet if a vowel follows, -n- does not turn into a; thus gh- is not followed by a vowel and
does not turn into h; and thus the underlying ghn- remains (ghnanti, aghnan).
19
192
√विद (Class II) ‘to know’ ् While regular, this verb is given here explicitly as it displays various kinds of internal sandhi.
Note the 2nd and 3rd Sg Impf, which display the same lack of actual endings as the corresponding
forms of e.g. √हन् above. A 2nd Sg अवेः is found as a more recognisable alternative form. Note
also the alternative ending of the 3rd Pl Impf -uḥ (which regularly occurs in the perfect tense
–› Chapter 27).

वेत्ति वित्तः विदन्ति 3rd अवेत् अवित्ताम् अविदन्/अविदः
ु
√ब्रू (Class II) ‘to speak’
-ī- appears in the strong forms of present and imperfect (as in bravīmi), with the exception of the
1st Sg Impf. In t he 3rd Pl of both tenses, i.e. in prevocalic position, the weak stem surfaces as bruvrather than brū-.

ब्रवीति ब्रूतः ब्वरुन्ति 3rd अब्रवीत् अब्रूताम् अब्वन् रु
√ब् (II) ‘to speak’ in the present and imperfect रू
√धा (Class III) ‘to put, place’ (and √दा (Class III) ‘to give’)
Root-final long -ā drops out completely in the weak forms, creating the weak stem dh-. In the
forms where we might expect buddha sandhi (2nd and 3rd Du, 2nd Pl), we find regular sandhi instead
(dh- becomes unvoiced and unaspirated, d- becomes unvoiced); the reduplicative d-, furthermore,
19
193
√कृ (Class VIII) ‘to make, do’
This verb is irregular in that it displays vowel gradation of both the root and the suffix: the strong
stem is kar-o-, the weak kur-u- (kur-v- before vowels). Note, furthermore, that the final -u- of the
weak stem is absent before -v- and -m- (i.e. in the 1st Du and Pl in both tenses), and throughout the
potential (कुर्याम्, कुर्याः, कुर्यात etc.). ्

Various Verbs
– In its strong forms, √स् ‘to praise’ displays तु vṛddhi rather than expected guṇa (स्तौमि, स्तौषि, स्तौत;
the weak forms are regular: 1st Pl स्मः तु , 3rd Pl स्वतु त with -uv- avoiding the cluster +
stv-).
– Class II verbs whose stems end in -ā do not show stem gradation at all, but keep the -ā throughout their paradigms: √या ‘to go’ has e.g. 3rd Sg यात and 3rd Pl या त.
– The same applies to √स्वप् (II) ‘to sleep’, which also displays the strong stem throughout; –› e.g.
3rd Sg स्वपिति (with an -i- before endings that begin with a consonant) and 3rd Pl स्वपन्ति.
– Noteworthy sandhi is found in √वच् ‘to speak’ and √द्विष् ‘to hate’: √वच् has a singular वग्मि, वक्षि,
वक्ति; the corresponding forms of √द्विष् ‘to hate’ are द्वेष्मि, द्वेक्षि, द्वेष्टि.
turns into aspirated dh-. Finally, the 3rd Pl Impf is अदधुः, using the ending we also saw in the corresponding form of √विद. – The verb √दा (III) ‘to give’ also has a weak stem ् d-.

REVIEW QUESTIONS
1) How is the potential of athematic verbs formed?
2) Which three forms does the stem of √हन् ‘to kill’ take across the paradigm? (And perhaps you
remember: how are these related to each other/how do they come to be?)
3) What are the weak stems of √धा III ‘to put, place’, √दा III ‘to give’ and √अस् ‘to be’?
4) Which formal irregularity is found in the imperfect of √अस् ‘to be’?
5) What does the initial vowel of √इ ‘to go’ regularly appear as in the imperfect?
6) ‘The strong stem of √कृ to do’ is doubly strong, the weak one doubly weak.’ Explain.

CHAPTER 20
Introduction to Pronouns; Pronouns I
As we have seen, how a Sanskrit noun is declined depends on the final sound of its stem. Pronouns –
words such as English ‘I’, ‘she’ or ‘this’ – display yet another set of endings. While many of these
have already been encountered in relation to other paradigms, some are unique to pronouns.
Sanskrit has personal pronouns for the first and second person (equivalent to English I and you –›
Chapter 32) and the third person (English he/she/it, see below), demonstrative pronouns (denoting
this or that, see below and –› Chapters 22, 36, 39), and a number of so-called pronominal adjectives
that employ some pronoun endings (–› Chapter 22). Note that the 1st- and 3rd-person personal pronouns and demonstrative pronouns do not have a vocative: for addressing someone, the 2nd-person
pronoun (त्वम् ‘you’) is used; त्वम्, in turn, functions as both nominative and vocative.
Furthermore, some pronouns employ different stems within one paradigm, which makes them
more difficult to memorise. This also has the effect that the common practice of citing a nominal
form by its stem (नरैः, नरम्, नरौ, for example, all have the same stem, नर-) cannot be used, and
so this book cites the pronouns in question by reference to both their Nom Sg Masc and their
‘stem’ form used in compounds (which is often formally identical to the Nom Sg Ntr). Thus we get
स:/तद-् ‘he, she, it; this’ and अयम्/इदम्- ‘this; that’ below, एषः/एतद-् ‘this; that’ in Chapter 22, अहम्/
मत्- ‘I’, त्वम्/त्वत्- ‘you’ in Chapter 32 and असौ/अदस्- ‘that’ in Chapter 39.
20
201
Note:
– As in other paradigms, the neuter is identical to the masculine except in NomAcc; Nom and Acc
Ntr are identical to each other in singular, dual and plural, respectively.
– The Sg is most different from what we have encountered so far; in the Du and Pl, the forms and
endings are largely recognisable. Thus: concentrate first on memorising the Masc Sg; note the
unfamiliar Loc Sg form तस्मिन्. Then study especially the other forms that are unexpected: Nom
Pl त, ेGen Pl तेषाम्.
– When memorising the feminine paradigm, again focus especially on the singular. Note the various formal similarities with ā-stems. Do not be confused by such forms as Dat Sg Masc तस् vs. मै
Dat Sg Fem तस् – the forms containing an - यै m- are masculine.
One final formal peculiarity: in front of words beginning with a consonant, the Nom Sg Masc सः
appears as स, thus giving e.g. स नरः ‘this man’ (rather than +
सः नरः > +
सो नरः). Thus it appears as स in
all environments except in front of a- (where sandhi leads to सो, as in सो ऽगच्छत ‘he came’). ्
The -t in the NomAcc Sg Ntr तत (which is originally a - ् d turned into -t by external
sandhi, and which you will re-encounter in other pronouns) is the same in origin as the
final -t in English neuter pronouns such as what, that or it.

2) Use and Meaning
Like adjectives, pronouns have different forms for the three different genders. In order to translate
a pronoun such as सः/तद-् correctly, we need to know what it refers to. The Acc Sg Masc form तम्
in a sentence such as तं पश्यामि needs to be translated into English as ‘I see him’ if तम् refers to a
man, but as ‘I see it’ if it refers to something grammatically masculine, but not biologically male (–›
nouns such as वृक्षः ‘tree’).
सः/तद-् functions as both a personal pronoun (translated as ‘he, she, it’) and a demonstrative pronoun. Used on its own, it can be translated in either way: तं पश्यामि = ‘I see this one’ or ‘I see him/it’.
Used together with a noun, स:/तद-् is usually to be translated as ‘this’: e.g. स उपायः ‘this approach’.
Yet it is also used with names whenever they are mentioned repeatedly in a text, as in स इन्द्रः ‘the
Indra we know, the aforementioned Indra’. In English translation, this स can simply be omitted: स
इन्द्रः is then simply ‘Indra’.
अयम्/इदम्- ‘THIS, THAT’
अयम्/इदम्- is a demonstrative pronoun whose meaning covers both that of English ‘this’ (i.e. the
one here, closer, more recent) and ‘that’ (i.e. the one there, further away, less recent).

अयम्/इदम्- ‘this, that’
Note:
– Apart from the Nom and Acc (see immediately below), the forms of this pronoun are mostly the
same as those of तद-्, but without the initial t-. Yet note the Instr Sg अनेन/अनया (not +
एन/+
अया),
the GenLoc Du अनयोः (not +
अयोः), and Instr Pl Masc (एभिः rather than +
ऐः).
20
203
– As for the Nom and Acc forms: in the singular, note that all forms except for the Acc Sg Fem
end in -am, making them look like accusatives. Make sure you are able to recognise each
form. (-am is added to forms that would otherwise have been very short. Note that without
this addition, im(-am) and id(-am) have the same endings as तम् and तद् (> तत् through
sandhi). The Du and Pl forms are straightforward: the endings already known from सः/
तद्
- are added to the stem im-.
EXERCISES

CHAPTER 21
The Future Tense; Middle and Passive Voice
THE FUTURE TENSE
The future tense has the same function as its English equivalent: it talks about things that will be. It
does not use the present stem (as present and imperfect did), but is formed by means of:
– a verbal root in guṇa (–› Chapter 7 on vowel gradation)
– the future marker -sya- or -iṣya-
– primary endings (i.e. the same endings as those used in the present tense).
Compare the future of √गम् ‘to go’:
The -i- in -iṣya- (with -ṣ- due to ruki; –› Chapter 6) is comparable to the -i- that appears in front
of other suffixes that begin with a consonant (such as -ta, -tvā or -tum; –› Chapter 8). As in those
other forms, one cannot predict which of the two suffixes (-sya- or -iṣya-) a verb takes. One may
even find two futures of the same verb, such as गंस्यति and गमिष्यति ‘he will go’ from √गम् ‘to go’.
While the future stem just described is unrelated to the present tense stem, the future of Class X
verbs and causatives is formed by adding -iṣya- to the present stem minus the thematic vowel:
कथयति ‘he tells’ –› कथयिष्यति ‘he will tell’; पातयति ‘he causes to fall, throws’ –› पातयिष्यति ‘he will
cause to fall, throw’.

Singular Dual Plural
1st गमिष्यामि गमिष्यावः गमिष्यामः
2nd गमिष्यसि गमिष्यथः गमिष्यथ
3rd गमिष्यति गमिष्यतः गमिष्यन्ति
Future active of √गम् ‘to go’
21
208
Where -sya- is used (rather than -iṣya-), internal sandhi results:
– Before -s-, stops lose any voicing and/or aspiration, and palatals become velars; after a velar, s
turns into ṣ according to ruki (e.g. √युज् ‘to join’: 3rd Sg Fut Act *yoj-sya-ti > *yok-sya-ti > योक्ष्यति
‘he will join’).
– ś turns into k (also turning the following s into ṣ according to ruki): √विश् ‘to enter’ –› 3rd Sg Fut
वेक्ष्यति ‘he will enter’; √दृश् ‘to see’ –› 3rd Sg Fut द्रक्ष्यति ‘he will see’.
– h also turns into k: √स्निह् ‘to love’ –› स्क्ष्यति ने ‘he will love’.
– Rarely, s turns into t: √वस्vas ‘to dwell’ –› 3rd Sg Fut वत्स्यति ‘he will dwell’.
In some verbs whose root-final consonant loses its aspiration (including h > k) through such sandhi, the closest preceding consonant becomes aspirated. Thus, √बुध् ‘to understand’ has a future
भोत्स्यति, or √दह् ‘to burn’, धक्ष्यति. This cannot be predicted from the shape of the verbal root. Thus,
remember this principle and be prepared to recognise such forms when they occur.
THE MIDDLE VOICE
1) Function
English has an active and a passive voice:
Active: She sees. You love. He addresses his friend.
Passive: She is seen. You are loved. He is addressed by his friend.
Sanskrit has an active, a passive and a third voice, the middle. All Sanskrit verb tenses have separate forms for active and middle. In the present and imperfect, there are, furthermore, separate
forms for the passive (see below). Middle forms did at one point have a distinct meaning, but this
distinct meaning has been lost in Classical Sanskrit. In the present and imperfect, middle forms
need to be translated just like active forms. Outside the present and imperfect, middle forms need
to be translated as either active or passive, depending on context (see section on the passive below);
yet middle forms are more commonly used with active than with passive meaning.
Active, middle and passive forms across the tenses
Present and imperfect Everywhere else: future, perfect, aorist
translate as active
Active forms translate as active
Middle forms ambiguous: translate as middle or
(more rarely) as passive
translate as passive Passive forms no separate passive form
21
209
Some verbs have both active and middle forms. Some have only one set of forms. Some verbs typically use one voice in one tense (e.g. just the active in the present), and the other or both voices in
another tense (e.g. just the middle or both active and middle in the future). Some verbs are active
or middle depending on what preverb (–› Chapter 10) they are compounded with. Whether a verb
is (typically) active or (typically) middle can be seen from the 3rd-person Sg form provided with
each verb in a glossary or dictionary (compare the new vocabulary at the end of this chapter).
The slightly unimaginative name of the ‘middle’ voice goes back to an ancient Western
grammatical term that attempted to describe what the middle was, namely a voice
somewhere ‘in the middle of ’ active and passive: while the subject of an active verb
acts upon and affects others (I hit him, to give a rather drastic example), the subject of a
passive verb is being acted on and is thus affected by the action (I am hit). A middle verb,
on the other hand, would originally have been used when the subject in some way both
acts and is acted upon, and thus is affected by the action. The middle voice might thus
express a reflexive notion (I see myself), an intransitive idea (I sleep) or just something
done for one’s own sake or in one’s own interest (I sacrifice to the gods (not on someone
else’s behalf, but for myself)). Ancient Indian grammatical terminology encapsulates
this range of meanings by referring to the middle as आत्मनेपद ‘form/word for oneself ’
(–› Chapter 29 on आत्मन्- ‘self ’), as opposed to परस्पदमै ‘word/form for another’ (परस्मै
Dat Sg of पर- ‘other’ –› Chapter 22).
2) Forms
Middle forms use the same stem as their active counterparts, but a separate set of endings. The
endings given below are used for both the present and the future tenses.
The frequent presence of final -e, combined with the parallels to corresponding active forms, helps
recognise a middle form. Yet note that the 1st Sg ending is -e, not +
-āme or similar, as one might expect given the relationship of e.g. the 2nd- or 3rd-person endings (Act -asi vs. Mid -ase, Act -ati vs.
Mid -ate). Also, note -ethe/-āthe and-ete/-āte in the dual: in spite of their internal -e-, the endings
-ethe/-ete, used in thematic verbs, are not potentials. -āthe/-āte are used in athematic verbs.

2nd -se -(e/ā)the -dhve
3rd -te -(e/ā)te -a(n)te
The primary middle endings
21
210
Compare the two paradigms below, conjugating the middle verb √भाष् (I) ‘to say, speak’ in the
present and in the future.
The middle forms of athematic verbs employ the same endings as thematic verbs; yet they always
use the weak stem; –› e.g. of √हु (Class III) 2nd Sg जुहुषे, 2nd Du जुह्वाथे. (Full paradigms are provided
in the Reference Grammar, Appendix III.)
Note that, according to the rules of external sandhi, final -e turns into -a before any word-initial
vowel except a-: भाषत उपविशति च ‘he speaks and enters’. This specific form of sandhi has been encountered rarely so far; be prepared to recognise it.
THE PASSIVE VOICE
1) Forms
In the present tense, the passive is formally distinct from the middle. It is formed by taking not the
present stem, but the verbal root in zero grade (sometimes guṇa), adding the passive marker -ya-
(-yā- in the 1st Du and Pl) and the endings of the middle. Compare the Act Sg and Pass forms of
√युज् (VII) ‘to link’ and Mid Sg and Pass forms of √यज् (I) ‘to sacrifice’ (zero grade *yj > ij):
√भाष्‘to say, speak’ in the present and future middle

THE NUTSHELL
Middle voice Passive voice Future tense
Recognisable: frequent final -e.
Many parallels to active endings.
Uses same stem as active.
Athematic verbs only use weak stem.
Distinct forms only in present:
Zero-grade root + -ya-
+ middle endings. Elsewhere
identical to middle.
Guṇa root + -sya-/-iṣya-
+ active or middle
endings.
Memorise the endings. Memorise possible changes in
roots ending in a vowel.
Memorise the sandhi
patterns before -s-.
In the passive, if a verbal root ends in a vowel, this vowel may change before the added -ya-:
long ā usually changes to ī: √दा –› दीयत ‘is given’ े
short i and u lengthen to ī and ū: √जि –› जीयत ‘is conquered’; े √श् –› रु श्यरू त ‘is heard’ े
short ṛ turns into -ri-, but after two consonants into -ar-: √भृ –› भ्रियत ‘is carried’, but े √स्मृ
–› स्मर्यत ‘is remembered’ े
long ṝ turns into -īr-, and after a labial into -ūr-: √त –› ॄ तीर्यत ‘is crossed’ े
Thus, if you do not recognise the verbal root in a passive verb,
try to see whether it is a known root that ends in a (different) vowel.
Some verbs use the root in guṇa as the basis for the passive: –› हन्यत ‘is killed’ or े लभ्यत ‘is taken’. े
Passives of Class X verbs and causatives are formed by adding -ya- + middle endings to the root
in the grade in which it appears in the active (the -aya- of the stem is dropped). Cf. e.g. भारयति –›
भार्यत ‘is caused to carry’. े
2) Syntax
As was pointed out in relation to (the mostly passive) ta-participles, the agent of a passive verb (by
whom an action is performed) is expressed in the instrumental case: बालो नरेण भृतः ‘The child was
carried by the man.’ The same holds for finite passive forms: बालो नरेण भ्रियते ‘The child is carried by
the man.’ In tenses where middle and passive have identical forms, the presence of such an agent
expression in the instrumental is what helps us identify a form as passive. In sentences such as बालो
नरेण द्रक्ष्यत and े बालो नरं द्रक्ष्यत, the difference between े नरेण in the instrumental and नरं in the accusative tells us that बालो नरेण द्रक्ष्यत must be passive ‘the child will be seen by the man’, while े बालो नरं
द्रक्ष्यत must be middle ‘the child will see the man’. े
Finally, note the potential confusion coming from middle Class IV verbs: the combination of their
usual present stem (weak root plus -ya-, such as √हृष् ‘to be excited’: present stem हृष्य-) with middle endings makes them look identical to passive verbs: √मन् IV ‘to think’ –› मन्यत ‘he thinks’. े
REVIEW QUESTIONS
1) How is the future tense formed?
2) What is the difference in meaning between the present active and middle?
3) In which tenses do we find passive forms? Describe the situation in the other tenses.
4) How is the middle voice formed?
5) How is the passive voice formed? What is special about vowel-final roots in this respect?

Linguistic note: seṭ/aniṭ
(For those who have been wondering about the -ta/-ita, -tvā/-itvā, -sya/-iṣya etc. variants.)
As we have seen in past participles, absolutives, infinitives, and now also in future forms, an -i- appears after some verbal roots that end in a consonant when these are followed by a suffix that begins
with a consonant. This -i- has no effect on the meaning of these forms, and thus e.g. the future can
be formed by adding either one of -sya- or -iṣya- to the verbal root. Sanskrit grammarians 2,500
years ago had also noticed this -i-, and accordingly split up verbal roots into two categories that they
called seṭ (*sa-iṭ) ‘with i’ and an-iṭ ‘without i’. The reason behind this phenomenon was identified
by comparative historical linguists in the late nineteenth century: at an earlier stage in the language,
there existed sounds (now referred to as laryngeals) that later disappeared, but that in some environments left traces of their former presence. The -i- is the trace that they left whenever they stood
between two consonants – which was the case e.g. whenever a root that ended in a consonant plus a
laryngeal was followed by a suffix that began with a consonant. Yet when those roots were followed
by anything that began with a vowel (e.g. the thematic vowel), the laryngeal disappeared without
a trace. Thus, e.g. √पत ‘to fly, fall’ once ended in such a laryngeal, which then left a trace in such ्
forms as pat-i-ta-, pat-i-tvā, pat-i-tum and pat-i-ṣyati; yet whenever the root √पत was followed by a ्
vowel, the laryngeal disappeared without a trace, giving us e.g. pat-ati. The laryngeals disappeared,
and thus the presence or absence of the -i- appeared to be random. As a result, especially in the
later language, the -i- may appear after roots where we now know there was no original laryngeal.

CHAPTER 22
More Participles; Pronouns II
MIDDLE AND PASSIVE PARTICIPLES OF PRESENT AND FUTURE
The present middle participle of a verb is formed by taking the present stem and adding the suffix
-māna- in the case of a thematic verb, or the weak present stem and adding -āna- in the case of an
athematic verb. Present middle participles decline as regular a-/ā-stems. For example:
√द्युत ‘to shine’ (Class I M ् id), present stem द्योत- –› द्योतमान- ‘shining’
 (-मानः (Masc), -माना (Fem), मानम् (Ntr))
√भुज् ‘to enjoy’ (Class VII), weak present stem भुञ्ज्- –› भु ञ्ज् ञ्जान- ‘enjoying’
As is the case with finite passive verb forms, the present passive participle is formed by adding the
middle suffix to the passive stem (root in zero grade (with possible changes –› Chapter 21) + -ya-):
√नी ‘to lead’ –› नीयमान- ‘being led’
√ईक् ‘to see’ –› ष् ईक्ष्यमान- ‘being seen’
√श् ‘to listen, hear’ –› रु श्यमान- रू ‘being listened to, heard’
√दा ‘to give’ –› दीयमान- ‘being given’
Note that passive forms are always thematic (the passive marker -ya- ends in the thematic vowel
-a), hence all present passive participles employ the thematic suffix -māna-. Like the ta-participles
encountered in Chapter 8, these participles are adjectives, agreeing with the noun they refer to in
case, number and gender. In English, they may sometimes be translated as running, being seen etc.,
but frequently are better rendered by means of a subordinate clause (see below).
Future middle and passive participles (which are identical to one another, as discussed in Chapter
21) are formed by adding the suffix -māna- to the future stem (which ends in an -a-, hence only
the thematic participle suffix is employed).
A noteworthy formal exception is the present middle participle of √आस् ‘to sit’, which is
आसीन- rather than the expected +
आसान-.
22
222
–› Chapter 8 for an introduction to participle usages (attributive, substantivised and in
place of a finite verb).
Examples: Present middle: बाला नार्या भाषमनायाः वचनानि शृणोति
‘The girl listens to the words of the speaking woman/of the woman who is
speaking.’
Present passive: ततः सर्वेभिः पूज्यमान आगच्छत्
‘Then came the one/the man who was worshipped by all.’
Future middle: सेनां पृतनायां योत्स्यमानां वेत्ति
‘He knows/recognises the army that is about to fight in the battle.’
Note that in English the suffix -ing can have one of two functions: it can be added to
verbal stems either to form present active participles (e.g. running as in running water or
I am running) or to form abstract nouns/gerunds such as running as in I like running or
Running is good for you. This formal identity in English sometimes causes confusion to
Sanskrit learners; yet the different meaning/functions of the two Sanskrit forms should
be enough to keep them apart.
PRONOUNS II: MORE THIRD-PERSON PRONOUNS
There are a number of pronouns that are declined exactly like सः/तद-् (Chapter 20):
– एषः/एतद-् is a demonstrative pronoun meaning ‘this’ or ‘that’. It is formed by adding e- before the
forms of सः/तद-्. Initial s- is turned into ṣ- according to the ruki rule (Nom Sg Masc एषः, Nom Sg
Fem एषा; but unaffected Acc Sg Masc एतम्, NomAcc Ntr Sg एतद etc.). ् एषः/एतद-् has a stronger
demonstrative meaning than सः/तद-्, which can be used to mean just ‘he’ etc.; yet in their demonstrative function, the two overlap.
– य- (in compounds: यद-्) is the relative pronoun. It has only one stem (ya-); its endings are exactly like those of सः/तद-्. Its use is explained in Chapter 23.
– क- (in compounds: किम्-) is the question pronoun meaning ‘who? what? which?’ It has only one
stem (ka-) and its endings are exactly like those of सः/तद-् with the exception of the NomAcc Sg
Ntr, which is not +
कद, but
् किम् ‘what?’ (which can also mean ‘why?’). This pronoun can be used
on its own (e.g. कं पश्यसि ‘Whom do you see?’) or together with a noun (e.g. कं नरं पश्यसि ‘Which
man do you see?’).
– अन्य- ‘other’ (in compounds: अन्य- or, rarely, अन्यद-्) declines exactly like सः/तद-्.
Some examples of compounds that include these pronouns are तत्पुरुष- ‘his servant’, कदर्थ- (Adj)
‘for what purpose?’ and यत्कुल- (Adj) ‘of which family’.
22
223
PRONOMINAL ADJECTIVES
A number of adjectives that are similar to pronouns in their meaning also have pronominal inflection. They are thus called pronominal adjectives.
– सर्व- ‘all’, विश्व- ‘all’, स्व- ‘one’s own’ and एक- ‘one, single’ all have a regular NomAcc Sg Ntr (सर्वम्
etc., not +
सर्वद), but otherwise have the same endings as ् स:/तद-् (e.g. Nom Pl Masc सर्वे/विश् or वे
Gen Pl सर्वेषाम्). This also usually applies to पर- ‘distant, other’ and पूर्व- ‘prior, first’, yet these can
also be found with regular adjectival (a- and ā-stem) endings.
– There are various combinations of a pronominal or also prepositional stem plus a comparative
or superlative suffix that may decline like pronouns or like regular a-/ā-stem adjectives. These
include such words as कतर- ‘which (of two)?’, अन्यतर- ‘either of two; other’, उत्तम- ‘highest, most
superior’ (from उद-् ‘up’) etc.
How are any of the adjectives above ‘similar to pronouns in their meaning’? Think of
adjectives such as ‘big’, ‘hot’ or ‘funny’. They all convey a certain quality. Pronouns such
as ‘this’ or ‘that’, on the other hand, do not. They simply point or refer to someone or
something, without actually describing any qualities or characteristics. Adjectives like
‘other’ or ‘prior’ also do not convey any actual qualities, but instead relate one thing to
another (‘this one’ vs. ‘the other one’, ‘the latter’ vs. ‘the former’ etc.). In a nutshell: if an
adjective does not convey any actual qualities, do not be surprised if it declines like a
pronoun. Be prepared to recognise those pronominal forms.
LEXICAL NOTE: परपर- basically means ‘removed, far’ (the words पर- and English ‘far’ are related). From this basis,
several rather specialised and perhaps unexpected meanings have developed. The idea of ‘far’ is
found not just with spatial, but also temporal, meaning; पर- may thus mean ‘long ago, ancient’, but
also ‘future’, and from that ‘later, next, following’. It is also used in the abstract sense of ‘exceeding,
much, more than’ and both ‘better’ and ‘worse’, or simply ‘other’. Something noticeably far may indeed be the furthest; and so, पर- may also mean ‘final, last’, or, in its abstract notion, ‘best, supreme,
highest’. Finally, as something or someone far away or ‘other’ is less likely to be on your side, परmay mean ‘opposite, adverse, hostile’ or ‘foreign’.
The trick to correctly interpreting (and thus translating) any given instance of a form of पर- is to
be aware both of its basic meaning and the fact that this basic meaning is interpreted widely; and
then to decide which nuance and thus translation of it fits a given context. This is generally a good
approach in translation, and you have probably already done so without noticing it in the case of

प्रह्लादमाधास्यति धर्मवृष्ट्या वृष्ट्या महामेघ इवातपान्ते॥ ७३ ॥
Notes: 73) The datives at the beginning of the stanza are the beneficiaries of the main verb.

अग्नि- (m.) – ‘fire’ (अग्निना Instr Sg)
आतप- (m.) – ‘heat; summer heat; summer’
इन्धन- (n.) – ‘kindling, fuel’

विपाटयिष्यत्ययमुत्तमेन सद्धर्मताडेन दरासदेन ु ॥ ७४ ॥
74) Main verb and subject are विपाटयिष्यति अयं (l.2) – the object of the verb is द्वारं, with which the
other Acc Sg Ntr forms agree. l.1 मोहतमःकपाटं is a dvandva within a bahuvrīhi – प्रजानाम् (translate here as ‘creatures’ or ‘people’) is dependent on अपयान-हेतोः.
अर्गल- (m./n.) – ‘(door-)bolt’

231
75) The skeleton of this stanza is एषः (i.e. the Buddha) धर्मराजः लोकस्य बन्धनमोक्षं करिष्यत. ेl.1 स्वैः

मोहेन वा कामसुखैर्मदाद्वा यो नैष्ठिकं श्रोष्यति नास्य धर्मम् ॥ ७६ ॥
76) l.1 तद here ‘thus’ –
् मा कृ थाः शोकम् ‘do not grieve!’ (प्रति here ‘about, on account of ’) – इमम्
refers to the Buddha – अस्मिन् begins a new sentence, with the structure स शोच्यः… यः – all of l.2.

CHAPTER 23
Relative and Correlative Clauses
This chapter discusses various uses of the pronouns introduced in Chapter 22.
RELATIVE CLAUSES
A relative clause offers further information about a word in the main clause. In the following examples, relative clauses are underlined, while the word they refer to (their ‘head’) is given in italics.
The girl who is playing with the cat is my sister.
The boy from whom I got this book is my friend.
I have already finished the chocolate that we bought yesterday.
The word that a relative clause refers to is called the head of that clause. Notice how in all three
examples the head precedes the relative clause.
Sanskrit relative clauses have the same function as their English counterparts. Yet there are three
formal differences:
1) The head noun is frequently included in the relative clause itself, and the relative clause as a
whole may precede the main clause.
2) The relative pronoun य- (in any of its forms) is usually picked up by a form of the demonstrative
pronoun सः/तद-् ‘he, this one’ etc. in the main clause.
3) The relative and demonstrative pronouns do not need to stand at the beginning of their clauses.
Thus, the English sentences above would typically look as follows in Sanskrit:
Which girl is playing with the cat, she is my sister.
From which boy I got this book, he is my friend.
Which chocolate we bought yesterday, that I have already finished.
23
233
Or also:
We bought yesterday which chocolate, that I have already finished.
Which we bought yesterday chocolate, that I have already finished.
And so on.
Two actual examples:
य आत्मनापत्रपते भृशं नरः ।
स सर्वलोकस्य गुरुर्भवत्युत ॥
(आत्मना अपत्रपत lit. ‘turns away from himself ’ –› ‘is े
modest about himself ’– भृशम् (Indc) ‘very, especially’ –
गुरुः ‘teacher’ (Nom Sg) – उत ‘also, even’)
‘The man who is especially modest about himself becomes the teacher of the whole world.’ (Lit.
‘Which turns away from himself especially man, he…’.) (Mahābhārata 5.33.127)
नृपेणावमतो यस् स स तु र्वैरवमन्यते
‘But who is looked down on (अवमतः) by the king, he is looked down on by all.’ (Lit. ‘By a
king looked down on but who, he by all is looked down on.’)
(Hitopadeśa 2.175)
To translate a Sanskrit relative clause into English, put its head in front of the relative clause,
and ignore the demonstrative that takes up the relative pronoun.
CORRELATIVE CLAUSES
Most Sanskrit relative clauses should more properly be called ‘correlative’. This technical term refers
to the ‘correlation’ (i.e. parallel use) between the relative pronoun (य-) and the personal pronoun
that it is picked up by (सः/तद-्). Usually, however, the term ‘correlative’ is reserved for a slightly
different kind of clause: there are a number of particles that are based on the stems of य- and सः/
तद-् and that are usually employed together. यदा… तदा, for example, means ‘when… then’ (यदा
स्मयसे तदा तुष्यामि ‘when you smile, then I am happy’; this was briefly introduced in Chapter 15);
यथा… तथा means ‘just as… so’ (यथा सिहो ं द्रवति तथा स द्रवति ‘just as a lion runs, so this man runs’, or,
more idiomatically, ‘he runs like a lion’; यथा was first introduced in Chapter 12).
23
234
To give an actual example:
वासांसि जीर्णानि यथा विहाय नवानि गृह्णाति नरो ऽपराणि ।
clothesAccPlNtr oldAccPlNtr just as take offAbs newAccPlNtr take3rdSgPres manNomSgMasc otherAccPlNtr
तथा शरीराणि विहाय जीर्णान्यन्यानि सं याति नवानि देही ॥ २ – २२ ॥
so bodiesAccPlNtr take
offAbs
oldAccPlNtr
otherAccPlNtr
take3rdSgPres newAccPlNtr soulNomSgMasc
‘Just as a man, having cast off old clothes, puts on other, new ones, so the soul, having
cast off old bodies, takes on new ones.’
(Bhagavad-Gītā 2.22)
The table below lists various forms used in such correlative clauses. In addition to forms from the
relative stem ya- and demonstrative stems ta- (–› सः/तद-्) and a-, there are also corresponding
forms from the interrogative/question stem ku-, as well as a few forms from other stems. Note that
each suffix creates a specific meaning (e.g. ‘at’ or ‘from’) that can often be used to refer to space,
time and abstracts (‘from a certain place’, ‘from a certain time’, ‘from/out of a certain reason’).

VOCABULARY
अतः ‘from this (place/time/reason)’
ततः ‘from that (…)’; ‘then, therefore’
यतः ‘from which (…), because’
कुतः ‘from which (…)? why?’
इतः ‘from this (…), now’
अत्र ‘here; now’
तत्र ‘there; then’
यत्र ‘(in which), where, when’ (relative)
कु त्र ‘where?’
235
INDEFINITES
An indefinite pronoun is used to refer not to a specific thing or individual, but to someone or
something in general. Like the English indefinites ‘whoever’ or ‘whatever’, indefinites in Sanskrit
are formed by adding a particle to the question pronoun. The particles most frequently used in this
way are चित, ्अपि and चन.
कः ‘who?’ –› e.g. कश्चित or ् को ऽपि ‘someone; whoever’
कस्य ‘whose?’ –› e.g. कस्य चन ‘someone’s; whoever’s’
कदा ‘when?’ –› e.g. कदा चित ‘at some time; sometimes’ ्
Indefinite meaning is also achieved by repeating a form: येन ‘by which’; येन येन ‘by whichever’. Adding न in front of these gives न कश्चित ‘no one’, ् न कदा चित् ‘not ever, never’ etc.
STYLISTIC NOTE: ALTERNATIVES TO RELATIVE CLAUSES
Relative clauses are less frequent in Sanskrit than they are in English. The reason for this is that
many simple relative clauses in English have their Sanskrit equivalents in participles or also compounds. As was described in Chapter 8, we thus translate e.g. the participle आगतं in आगतं नरमपश्यत्
not as +
‘he saw the having-come man’ but as ‘he saw the man who had come’; an English relative
clause may also be equivalent to a Sanskrit bahuvrīhi or other compound (e.g. हतपुत्र- ‘whose sons
are killed’, to give नारी जितन्दे्रिया ‘a woman whose sons are/have been killed’ or नारी वेदवित ‘a woman ्
who knows the Vedas’).
(continued overleaf)

236
तथा ‘so, in that way’
यथा ‘as, in which way’ (relative)
अथ ‘then’
तदा ‘then’
यदा ‘when’ (relative)
कदा ‘when?’
एकदा ‘once, at one time’
यदि ‘if ’
तर्हि ‘then’
तथा, अथ and various other words meaning ‘so’ or ‘then’ can also be used to mean ‘and’.
चित्, अपि, चन (postposed) turn question pronoun into indefinite
यो यः (repeated case form of य-): ‘whoever’
यतः… ततः ‘because… (thus)’
यत्र… तत्र ‘where… there)’
यदा… तदा ‘when… (then)’
यावत…् तावत् ‘as long as… (so long)’
यथा… तथा ‘just as/in which way… (so/in that way)’
यदि… तर्हि ‘if… then’

CHAPTER 24
Consonant Stems II; Imperatives
S-STEMS
s-stems can be nouns or adjectives. Of s-stem nouns, the large majority are neuter; most non-neuters are bahuvrīhi adjectives with an s-stem as their last member. s-stems employ the same endings
as other consonant stems (–› Chapter 15). There are stems ending in -as, -is and -us; the latter two
differ from the first in their internal sandhi:
– Before a vowel, -as remains as it is, while -is/-us turns into -iṣ/-uṣ according to the ruki rule
(–› Chapter 9).
– Before a voiced consonant, -as changes into -o, and -is and -us into -ir and -ur, respectively.
– In word-final position, and before unvoiced consonants (i.e. the Loc Pl ending -su), the -s in any
s-stem turns into -ḥ-.
As in other consonant stems, masculine and feminine s-stem forms are identical to each other, and
again, the neuter has separate forms only in the NomVocAcc of all numbers. The following table
compares the neuter s-stem मनस्- ‘mind’ (from √मन ‘to think’) with the masculine/feminine paradigm of the bahuvrīhi adjective सुमनस्- ‘good-minded, benevolent’. The neuter forms of सुमनस्-
employ the same endings as the neuter noun मनस्-.
as-stem noun and adjective: मनस्- (n.) ‘mind’, सुमनस्- (Adj) ‘good-minded, benevolent’

To illustrate the sandhi patterns of is- and us-stems, the neuter us-stem चक्स्-षु ‘eye’ and the adjective अचक्स्-षु ‘without eyes/sight; blind’ are given below. With the exception of the Nom Sg Masc/
Fem (-āḥ vs. -iḥ/-uḥ), as-, is- and us-stems have the same endings and only show systematic differences in their internal sandhi.

Note:
– There is one formal difference between as-stems on the one hand and is-/us-stems on the other:
the NomVoc Sg Masc Fem of as-stems ends in -āḥ, while that of is-/us-stems has a short vowel
and appears as -iḥ/-uḥ, respectively.
– The Ntr NomVocAcc Pl -āṃsi/-īṃṣi/-ūṃṣi can perhaps best be remembered in relation to the
equivalent vowel-stem forms (-āni/-īni/-ūni); in front of the stem-final -s, the nasal turns into
anusvāra -ṃ-.
IMPERATIVES
In English, the imperative expresses commands: ‘Pay attention!’ ‘Run!’ ‘Stop!’ Here, an imperative thus
exists only in the second person, in which the speaker addresses someone directly. In Sanskrit, on the
other hand, the imperative has a wider range of meanings and thus also a wider range of forms. Sanskrit second-person imperatives are very similar to their English counterparts and can be translated
as such: गच्छ thus simply is ‘go!’. Third-person imperatives lack a direct English equivalent and thus
are less straightforward to translate: गच्छत, for example, could be translated as ‘let him go’, ‘may he go’, ु
‘he may go’ or ‘I want him to go’. It is up to us to decide what the closest English equivalent in each
specific situation is. In the first person singular, a command is impossible (after all, even if we were to
24
243
talk to ourselves and order ourselves to do something, we would likely address ourselves in the second
person); instead, we find the meaning of ‘what can/may I do’, ‘what should I do’. In the dual and plural,
these forms can have the meaning of ‘let’s’ as in ‘let’s go, let’s do this’ etc. First-person ‘imperatives’ are
much rarer than those in other persons. Their memorisation is thus of secondary importance.
Imperatives of thematic and athematic verbs have identical endings in all forms except for the 2nd
Sg. Athematic verbs also have an unusual pattern of strong and weak forms (outlined below).

3rd भुनक्तु भुङ्क्ताम् भुञ्जन्तु भुङ्क्ताम् भुञ्जाताम् भुञ्जताम्
Note:
– All shaded forms are identical to the respective imperfect indicative forms without the augment.
– The 3rd Sg and Pl are identical to each other but for the absence (Sg) or presence (Pl) of a nasal
(which in the athematic middle 3rd Pl turns into -a- between consonants). They are thus parallel
e.g. to indicative -ti vs. -nti.
– Thematic 2nd-Sg imperatives use the present stem without any endings. Their athematic counterparts have the ending -dhi/-hi (-dhi is used after consonants; after vowels, we sometimes find
-hi, sometimes -dhi). The exception to this are Class V verbs, which display the same endingless
form as all thematic classes do; –› शृणु ‘listen!’).
– Finally, in athematic imperatives, all first persons and the 3rd Sg Act use the strong stem, all
others the weak stem.
24
244
Negated Commands and Alternatives to the Imperative
To negate an imperative (as in English ‘don’t do that!’), Sanskrit uses the particle मा. It is usually
used together with an unaugmented aorist (–› Chapter 38), but may also be combined with an
imperative (मा गच्छ ‘don’t go!’) or a present potential (मा गच्छेत ‘he shouldn’t/mustn’t go ् !’). Over
time, such prohibitions are increasingly expressed by other means: अलम् ‘enough’ used with a
noun in the instrumental, such as अलं भयेन, literally means ‘enough with (your) fear’, but in effect
expresses ‘stop being afraid, don’t be afraid’. Negated gerundives (Chapter 33) have the same
effect: नरो न हन्तव्यः literally means ‘the man is a not-to-be-killed one’, i.e. ‘he must not be killed’,
‘don’t kill him!’.
In positive commands, the potential (Chapter 12) also overlaps in function with the imperative:
गच्छतु and गच्छेत can both express the idea of ‘he should go ् !’.
Practical Note
This is a large number of new forms. Yet the first-person forms can mostly be ignored for now, and
several forms, especially in the active, are identical to the corresponding imperfect forms without
an augment. Thus focus on memorising the remaining second- and third-person forms. A good
way of remembering the various 2nd Sg imperative forms is to memorise these common examples:
उत्तिष्ठ ‘stand up!’, युध्यस्व ‘fight!’, ब्रूहि ‘speak!’, शृणु ‘listen!’.
THE NUTSHELL
s-stems Imperatives
Nouns: mostly neuter. Used for commands and requests.
Regular consonant-stem endings.
Note: as-stem Nom Sg Masc/Fem ends in -āḥ.
Partly = imperfect forms without augments.
Sandhi:
before vowels: as remains as; is, us > iṣ, uṣ
before voiced consonants: as > o; is, us > ir, ur
(= external sandhi)
word-final, before unvoiced consonant:
as, is, us > aḥ, iḥ, uḥ (= external sandhi)
Memorise the thematic second- and thirdperson forms of imperatives. Be prepared to
recognise the corresponding athematic forms
(note: 2nd Sg -(d)hi, except for Class V)

CHAPTER 25
Noun Stem Gradation; Consonant Stems III
NOUN STEM GRADATION
Chapter 15 introduced dental stems and the pattern of internal sandhi contained in them. Stems
ending in -vant, -mant and -ant also end in a -t and thus display the same internal sandhi patterns
as other t-stems. They also use the same endings as all other consonant stems. Yet they have one
further feature: they all show gradation of the stem.
Apart from sandhi of their final sounds, noun stems such as मरुत्- ‘wind’ or आपद-् ‘accident’ do not
change their form across the various cases. Nouns with stem gradation, on the other hand, have
a strong and a weak form of the stem, differentiated usually by guṇa vs. zero grade of their last
vowel. (The principle behind this is the same as that behind the stem changes of athematic verbs.)
Of stems in -mant-, -vant- or -ant-, the weak grade forms end in -mat-, -vat- and -at- respectively
(< *mṇt etc. –› Chapter 7 on the appearance of nasals between consonants). The strong forms are
found in the Masc NomVocAcc Sg and Du and the NomVoc Pl. All other forms are weak. Examples follow immediately below.
MORE DENTAL STEMS: VANT-/MANT-STEMS; TAVANT-PARTICIPLES;
(A)NT-PARTICIPLES; MAHĀNTvant/mant-stems are formed by adding either one of these suffixes (more frequently -vant-) to a
noun to express possession: गुण-वन्त्-, for example, literally means ‘having (good) qualities’, and
thus ‘virtuous’; धी-मन्त्- literally means ‘having thought’, and thus ‘intelligent’. Both types are declined according to the following pattern:
25
252
Note:
– The strong cases are shaded. (The Ntr NomVocAcc Pl are actually not strong, but contain the
nasal we saw in those cases elsewhere; –› e.g. s-stem मनांसि or t-stem जगन्ति.)
– Notice the Nom Sg Masc ending in -ān: the word-final consonant cluster *-nt(s) is reduced to
just -n, and the preceding -a- is lengthened in compensation. (–› Chapter 15 on the Sanskrit
treatment of word-final consonant clusters.)
– In the Voc Sg, which, like most other vocatives, consists of just the stem, final -t is dropped
without any compensation.
Feminine vant-/mant-stems are formed by adding -ī to the weak form of the stem (giving e.g.
गुणवती-). They are declined like regular ī-stems (–› Chapter 13).
Adverbial Use of vant-stems
Used adverbially in the Acc Sg Ntr, vant-stems can describe the manner in which something
happens:
चक्रवत् परिवर्तन्तेह्यर्थाश्च व्यसनानि च
(परि-√वृत ‘to go around, revolve’; ् अर्थ- (m.) here ‘fortune’; व्यसन- (n.) ‘ill luck, misfortune’)
‘Fortunes and misfortunes revolve like a wheel (चक्रवत).’ ्
(Mahābhārata 4.20.4)

tavant-participles
The suffix -vant is added to ta-participles to form a past active participle: on the basis of e.g.
लिखित- ‘having been written’, we find लिखितवन्त्- ‘having written’. They are declined exactly like
other vant-stems.
(a)nt-participles
The suffix -(a)nt is used to form the present and future active participles. -nt- is added to the present stem of thematic verbs, thus giving e.g. भरन्त्- (bhara-nt-) ‘carrying, one who is carrying’, नयन्त्-
‘leading’, गच्छन्त्- ‘going’, पश्यन्त्- ‘seeing’ etc. Present participles of athematic verbs are formed by
adding -ant- to the weak form of the stem, giving e.g. सन्त्- (s-ant-) ‘being’, घ्नन्त्- (ghn-ant-) ‘killing’,
शृण्वन्त्- ‘listening’ etc. The future active participle is formed by adding -nt- to the future stem; –›
गमिष्यन्त्- ‘(one who is) about to go’.
(a)nt-stems are declined identically to vant/mant-stems, with one exception: the Nom Sg Masc
forms end in -an, not in -ān. Thus पश्यन्त्- has a Nom Sg Masc पश्यन्, Acc पश्यन्तम्, Instr पश्यता etc.
One further exception: Class III verbs here show only the weak form of the stem. Thus the present
active participle of e.g. √हु is जुह्वत्-/juhvat- (Nom Sg Masc जुह्वत, ्Acc Sg Masc जुह्वतम् etc.).
The Feminines of vant-/mant-/ant-stems
These are all regular ī-stems (–› Chapter 13). The feminine forms of present active participles are
created by adding -ī to the strong participle stem of a thematic verb (e.g. पश्यन्ती-) or the weak stem
of an athematic verb (e.g. सती- ‘being, one who is’ from √अस्, or बिभ्यती- ‘fearing, one who fears’
from √भी). The feminines of future active participles add -ī to either the strong or, more rarely, the
weak participle stem (भरिष्यन्ती-/भरिष्यती- ‘(one who is) about to carry’), those of past active participles add -ī to the weak participle stem (e.g. लिखितवती-).

to go’
‘having carried, one

The distribution of strong vs. weak stem in the feminine forms is mirrored by the respective Ntr
NomVocAcc Du forms (whose ending is -ī), which are strong of participles whose feminines are
strong, and weak when the feminines are weak.
–› Chapter 8 on participle usage.
mahāntIn this context, the adjective महान्त्- ‘big, great’ is also relevant. (We have already encountered it as
the first member of compounds, where it appears as महा- –› महा-राज- ‘great king’.) Like other (a)ntstems, महान्त्- has stem gradation, yet while the weak stem shows the expected zero grade (महत्-),
the strong stem stands not in guṇa, but in vṛddhi (महान्त्-, rather than the perhaps expected +
महन्त्-).
Thus we find SgNom महान्, Acc महान्तम्, I महता; Fem Nom Sg महती etc. (but note Voc Sg Masc महन्).
महा- used in compounds creates both karmadhārayas and bahuvrīhis: महारथ- can mean both ‘great
chariot’ and ‘one whose chariot is great, having a great chariot’, i.e. ‘a warrior’.
THE NUTSHELL
(ta)vant-/mant-, (a)nt-stems
Endings, internal sandhi: same as t-stems (Chapter 15).
Stem gradation: Masc NomVocAcc Sg & Du, NomVoc Pl, (Ntr NomVocAcc Pl)
 = strong (guṇa); others: weak (zero grade).
Feminines: regular ī-stems; -ī added to strong or weak stem.
-mant-/-vant- added to nouns gives
meaning ‘having (that noun)’:
गुणवन्त्- ‘having virtue, virtuous’.
-nt- added to present stem of thematic verbs,
-ant- to weak stem of athematic verbs:
present active participle, e.g. पश्यन्त्- ‘seeing’;
-nt- added to future stem: future active
participle: गमिष्यन्त्- ‘about to go’.
-vant- added to ta-participle: past active participle भृतवन्त्- ‘having carried’.
mahānt- ‘great’: vṛddhi in strong stem, zero grade in weak stem,
mahā- at beginning of compounds.
LEXICAL NOTE: THE EARTH
Sanskrit uses a number of words to describe the earth. The earth was perceived as female, and
words for it are grammatically feminine. A number are feminine forms of adjectives: पृथिवी-
‘the broad one’, मही- ‘the great one’, less frequently अचला- ‘the non-moving one’ (from √चल्
25
‘to move’) or अनन्ता- ‘the endless one’ (–› अन्त- ‘end’). Also very frequent is the root noun भू-
(literally ‘being’), or, formed on its basis, भूमि- (both are feminine). This is just one example of
how, especially in literary texts, it is very common for one concept to be referred to by different
words, especially if the concept is an important one (as ‘earth’, i.e. territory, or ‘battle’ are across the
Sanskrit epics.)
REVIEW QUESTIONS
1) In nouns with stem gradation, which cases are strong, which are weak?
2) How many different stems end in -nt? Describe the form and function/meaning of each.
3) How do the present active participles of Class III verbs differ from those of other verb classes?
4) If the difference between guṇa and zero grade is the loss of an -a-, how can e.g. -mat- be the
zero grade of -mant-?
RECOMMENDED REVIEW
Go over the remarks in Chapter 8 on the use and translation of participles.

CHAPTER 26
i- and u-Stems
In Chapter 13, we were introduced to ī- and ū-stems. These employed nearly identical endings
and were parallel in how their stems changed in the different cases. The same is the case with
their short-vowel counterparts: i- and u-stems have identical endings and undergo the same stem
changes. This chapter thus discusses only i-stems in detail; u-stems will be briefly compared further down.
I-STEM NOUNS
All three genders are found of i-stem nouns. Each gender has a separate paradigm. Briefly look
over the following examples, and then use the notes below to guide you through these forms.

i-stem nouns of all genders: अग्नि- (m.) ‘fire’, वारि- (n.) ‘water’, मति- (f.) ‘mind’
(Shaded fields: overlap with endings of ī-stems.)
Neuters
Neuter i-stems are the most straightforward in their declension. They add an -n to the end of their
stem before any ending that begins with a vowel: वारि- –› वारिन्-, thus giving e.g. Instr Sg वारिणा,
Dat Sg वारिणे (with n > ṇ after r; –› Chapter 6 on this sandhi) etc. They effectively employ the same
endings as neuter consonant stems (cf. neuter s-stems, Chapter 24). Note the long -ī- in the Gen Pl
वरीणाम्, parallel to all other vowel-stems (such as a- and ā-stem -ānām, ī-stem -īnām and ū-stem
-ūnām). As in all neuters, NomAcc are identical within each number.
Masculines
Masculine i-stems require the most attention. In the Instr Sg, they add an unexpected -n- to their
stem (अग्निना, parallel to Ntr वारिणा). Where they do not add -n-, the grade of their stem-final vowel changes, and so may the grade of the case ending: in the VocDatAblGen Sg and in the Nom Pl,
their stem ends in -e rather than -i, that is, in the full rather than zero grade of this vowel. This full
grade appears as -e- before a consonant, as in Gen Sg अग्नेः, but as -ay- before a vowel, as in DatAbl
Sg अग्नये. Dat Sg and Nom Pl add the expected endings onto this strong stem (agnay-e, agnay-aḥ).
In the AblGen Sg, on the other hand, it appears that we are getting the full grade of the stem (अग्ने-
rather than अग्नि-) combined with the zero grade of the ending (-ḥ instead of -aḥ). Finally, note the
Loc Sg ending in -au. Given these numerous unexpected forms, it is best to memorise especially
the singular of this paradigm rather than try to remember it in reference to others.
Feminines
Feminine i-stems are identical to their masculine counterparts, with three exceptions: the Instr Sg
is मत्या (which adds the Instr Sg ending -ā to the regular prevocalic form of the stem, maty-). In
the Acc Pl, we find the ending -īḥ rather than Masc -īn, a pair of forms that is parallel to e.g. Masc
26
263
a-stem Acc Pl -ān, Fem ā-stem -āḥ). Finally, while they may have the same endings as masculines,
feminine i-stems may have endings parallel to those of ī-stems in the DatAblGenLoc Sg (shaded
fields in the table).
Most feminine i-stems are abstract nouns formed by adding the suffix -ti to a verbal stem in zero
grade: e.g. √नी ‘to lead’ –› नीति- ‘leading, guidance, (moral) conduct’; √मन् ‘to think’ –› मति- ‘thought,
mind’. The same internal sandhi affects the -t- of -ti as that of e.g. the past participle suffix -ta
(–› Chapter 8): –› दृष्टि- ‘sight’ from √दृश्, वृद्धि- ‘growth’ from √वृध् ‘to grow’ or बुद्धि- ‘understanding’
from √बुध्.
U-STEM NOUNS
As was pointed out above, u-stems are formed completely parallel to i-stems. In their internal sandhi, i corresponds to u, ī to ū, y to v, e to o and ay to av. Both stems have the Loc Sg Masc ending
-au. Make sure not to confuse the very similar AblGen Sg (e.g. गुरोः) and GenLoc Du (e.g. गुर्वोः)
u-stem nouns of all genders: धनु- (m.) ‘bow’, अश्- (n.) ‘tear’, धेनु- (f.) ‘cow’ रु

I- AND U-STEM ADJECTIVES
There are not only i- and u-stem nouns, but also adjectives. Generally, i- and u-stem adjectives
are formally identical to nouns of the same gender; but there are two exceptions. Neuter i- and
u-stem adjectives may form their cases in the same way as neuter i-/u-stem nouns; yet in all those
cases where neuter nouns add an -n-, adjectives may also take the same forms as the masculine.
26
Also, while feminine u-stem adjectives may be formally identical to feminine u-stem nouns, they
may also appear as ī-stems: thus, the feminine of गुरु- ‘heavy, important’ is गुर्वी-, that of बहु-‘much;
many’ is बह्वी-.
THE NUTSHELL
i-stems and u-stems use the same set of endings.
Their internal sandhi is parallel: i/u, ī/ū, iy/uv, e/o, ay/av.
Note: Feminines of u-stem adjectives may be ī-stems.
Masculine: memorise! Neuter: adds -n- before endings
that begin with a vowel.
Feminine: like the masculine,
except in Instr Sg (-yā) and
Acc Pl (-īḥ). Alternative
‘feminine’/ī-stem forms in
DatAblGenLoc Sg.
Most of these are abstract nouns
formed by addition of -ti to the
zero grade of a verbal root.
Identical adjective forms. Adjectives may be like
masculines in all forms that
add an -n-.

CHAPTER 27
The Perfect Tense I: Regular Perfect Formation
There are four things we need to know about the perfect, one concerning its meaning, and three
concerning its formation. The meaning of the perfect in Classical Sanskrit is identical to the imperfect: both refer to the past. There was once a semantic difference between them (which is why
there are two different sets of forms), but this difference has been lost.
Perfect forms consist of three elements:
a) a reduplicative syllable
b) the verbal root in strong or weak form
c) a special perfect ending
Combining a) and b), we arrive at the perfect stem. Note that this stem is unrelated to the present
tense stem, and thus there are not ten different classes of perfect formations, but just the one.
Compare the perfect of √विश् ‘to enter’ (given in transliteration to facilitate recognising the individual elements):
Systematically put, the perfect is formed in the following way:
a) The reduplicative syllable comes first and consists of the first consonant and the vowel of the
zero-grade root: the reduplicative syllable of √विश् is thus वि-. (See below for more details.)
Perfect active and middle of विश् ‘to enter’
Active Middle
Sg Du Pl Sg Du Pl
1st vi-veś-a vi-viś-i-va vi-viś-i-ma vi-viś-e vi-viś-i-vahe vi-viś-i-mahe
2nd vi-veś-i-tha vi-viś-athuḥ vi-viś-a vi-viś-i-ṣe vi-viś-āthe vi-viś-i-dhve
3rd vi-veś-a vi-viś-atuḥ vi-viś-uḥ vi-viś-e vi-viś-āte vi-viś-ire
27
272
b) The root is strong (i.e. its vowel stands in guṇa) in the active singular (√विश् –› वेश्-), and weak
(vowel in zero grade) in all other forms (√विश् –› विश्-), thus displaying the same pattern of
stem gradation as found in athematic verbs in the present tense (–› Chapter 18).
c) The endings are unique to the perfect (but note the usual -v- in the 1st Du, -m- in the 1st Pl, and
similarity between 2nd and 3rd Du endings). Roots ending in a consonant insert an -i- before
endings that begin with a consonant.
To analyse two forms explicitly:
vi- -veś- -i- -tha
2nd Sg Perf Act reduplicative
syllable
root in guṇa
vowel between
consonants ending
vi- -viś- - -e
1st/3rd reduplicative Sg Perf Mid
syllable
root in zero
grade ending
Notes on Reduplication
The example above features the simplest kind of reduplication, in which the consonant reduplicates in identical form. Yet note the various possible changes, which are identical to those in Class
III verbs (–› Chapter 18).
Aspirated consonants reduplicate without aspiration: √भुज् ‘to enjoy’ –› 1st Sg Perf Act बुभोज.
Velar consonants reduplicate as palatals: √कृ ‘to make, do’ –› 1st Sg Perf Act चकर. h, frequently
representing original aspirated velar *gh, is reduplicated as j, the unaspirated palatal counterpart of
gh (√हस् ‘to laugh’ –› 1st Sg Perf Act जहस). Of initial consonant clusters, only the first consonant is
reduplicated (√क्षिप् ‘to throw’ –› 1st Sg Perf Act चिक्पषे) unless it consists of s + stop, in which case
it is the stop that reduplicates (स्था ‘to stand’ –› strong perfect stem तस्था-; √स् ‘to praise’ –› strong तु
perfect stem तुष्टो-).
Vowels reduplicate in a different manner from what we have encountered in Class III presents.
Roots that contain i/ī or u/ū have -i- or -u- as their reduplicative vowel, respectively: भुज् –› बुभुज्-,
क्षिप् –› चिक्षिप्-. In all other cases, the reduplicative vowel is -a-: √कृ –› चकृ -; √दा –› ददा-.
Verbs whose root ends in u/ū add a -v- before endings that begin with a vowel: √श् –› 3 रु rd Pl Act
शुश्वुः रु (śu-śru-v-uḥ), √स् –› 3 तु rd Sg Mid तुष्टुवे (with retroflexion of s –› ṣ due to ruki). Verbs whose
27
root ends in i/ī may add a -y-, or the i/ī may change into a -y- itself: –› e.g. √नी –› 3rd Pl Act निन्युः.
Root-final ṛ changes into r: √कृ –› 3rd Pl Act चक्रुः.
There are some more details concerning how the Sanskrit perfect is formed that will be introduced
in the next chapter. Until then, form perfects only of verbs given in the Exercises, and focus on
memorising the perfect endings as repeated below.

CHAPTER 28
The Perfect Tense II: Irregular and Unexpected Forms
There are irregular and unexpected forms in all three components of the perfect verb – reduplicative syllable, stem and ending.
Reduplication
When a root begins with a consonant, this consonant and the vowel contained in the root in zero
grade are repeated to form the reduplicative syllable: thus, the root √विश् ‘to enter’ has the (weak)
perfect stem वि-विश्-. Yet when a root begins with a vowel, there is no initial consonant to reduplicate, and we find just the vowel of the (zero-grade) root reduplicated: thus, the root √इष् ‘to
want’ has the (weak) perfect stem ईष्- (i-iṣ-, with the two i’s merging into long ī-). Yet in the strong
forms, where the root stands in guṇa, a glide appears between the reduplicative vowel and the root,
resulting in e.g. 1st Sg इयेष (i-y-eṣ-a). As the table below shows, we find very similar forms in some
roots that begin with y- and v-.
Strong stem (here: in 1st Sg) Weak stem (here: in 3rd Pl)
√इष् ‘to want’ इयेष (iy-eṣ-a) ईषुः (i-iṣ-uḥ)
√उष् ‘to burn’ उवोष (uv-oṣ-a) ऊषुः (u-uṣ-uḥ)
√यज् ‘to worship’ इयज (i-yaj-a) ईजुः (i-ij-uḥ)
√वच् ‘to say’ उवच (u-vac-a) ऊचुः (u-uc-uḥ)
The reason behind the behaviour of the affected roots beginning with y- and v- is simple:
these are all roots cited in guṇa because giving their zero grade would not allow us to
infer the form of all their grades (–› Chapter 7). When looked at in the zero grade (which
is the form that determines the shape of the reduplicative syllable), a root such as √यज्
(zero grade इज्) begins with an i- in the same way that √इष् does.
A small number of verbal roots beginning with (vocalic) ṛ- or with a- before more than
one consonant reduplicate in a rather unusual way: they add the syllable ān- before
the root. Thus, √ऋच् ‘to praise’ (cf. the Ṛg-veda (also written Rigveda), literally ‘praise
28
279
knowledge’) has a 3rd Sg Perf Act आनर्च (3rd Pl आनृचुः), and √अञ्ज् ‘to smear’ has the 3 ञ्ज् rd Sg
Perf Act आनञ्ज. Roots beginning with a long vowel often form the periphrastic perfect
(–› Chapter 34).
Stems
Regularly, the strong forms (the active singular) employ the root in guṇa, the weak forms (all others) the root in zero grade. Yet note the following:
a) Roots that in guṇa contain an -a- that is followed by just one consonant always appear in vṛddhi in the 3rd Sg, and sometimes also in the 1st Sg: √पत ‘to fall; fly’ has a 1 ् st Sg पपत or पपात; its
3rd Sg is always पपात; √नी ‘to lead’ has a 1st Sg निनय or निनाय; its 3rd Sg निनाय.
b) Roots that have 1) just –a- as their guṇa vowel and 2) an initial consonant that reduplicates as
itself (rather than as its unaspirated or palatal counterpart) display the following weak form:
the root does not reduplicate; the root vowel changes to -e-.
√पत ‘to fall, fly’ ् –› 3rd Pl पेतुः (but compare 3rd Sg पपात)
√नम् ‘to bow’ –› 3rd Pl नेमुः (3rd Sg ननाम)
√सद ‘to sit’
् –› 3rd Pl सेदः
ु (3rd Sg ससाद)
c) Roots ending in -ā lose that -ā in their weak forms.
√धा ‘to place, put’ –› 1st Pl दधिम, 3rd Pl दधुः (da-dh-uḥ)
√दा ‘to give’ –› 3rd Pl ददः
ु (da-d-uḥ)
√स्था ‘to stand’ –› 3rd Du तस्थतुः (ta-sth-atuḥ)
Forms Difficult to Recognise
Sometimes, forms that are regular may nevertheless be difficult to recognise. In the weak forms of
roots ending in a nasal, such as √गम्, the regular zero grade, gm, does not appear as ga (as in the
absolutive गत्वा, or in any other form where it is followed by a consonant), but remains gm before
the vowels that follow throughout all weak forms: –› e.g. 1st Du जग्मिव, 1st Pl जग्मिम, 3rd Pl जग्मुः
ja-gm-uḥ.
Endings
In the case of roots ending in -ā, the ending of both 1st and 3rd Sg is -au: √स्था –› 1st + 3rd Sg तस्थौ (note
3rd Pl तस्थुः); √दा –› 1st + 3rd Sg ददौ.
Irregular Paradigms
– A few roots show guṇa even in the weak stem (e.g. तत्यजुः, सस्मरुः).
– √भू ‘to be’ has the stem बभूव्- throughout the perfect paradigm.
28 – √अस् ‘to be’ has a long initial ā- throughout its paradigm: 1st Sg आस, and e.g. 1st Pl आसिम.
– √विद ‘to know’ does not have a reduplicative syllable: 1 ् st Sg वेद, 3rd Pl विदः
ु.
– √हन् ‘to kill’, whose underlying form *√ghan we encountered in some of its present tense forms
(e.g. 3rd Pl घ्नन्ति –› Chapter 19), has gh- rather than h- throughout its perfect forms: e.g. 1st Sg
जघन, 3rd Pl जघ्नुः.
A number of full perfect paradigms are provided in the Reference Grammar
(Appendix III) for the sake of further illustration. Note that Class X verbs form their
perfects in an entirely different way, which will be introduced in Chapter 34 (‘The
periphrastic perfect’).

CHAPTER 29
ṛ-Stems, n-Stems; the Periphrastic Future
Ṛ-STEMS
ṛ-stems are vowel-stems; but while most of the endings they employ have already been introduced
in relation to other stems, the combination in which they use them is unique. Especially the singular needs to be memorised carefully. ṛ-stems display straightforward internal sandhi: the stem-final
sound surfaces as vocalic -ṛ- between consonants and as consonantal -r- everywhere else. In final
position, it changes into -ḥ in accordance with external sandhi. Like vant-/mant- and ant-stems (–›
Chapter 25), ṛ-stems have stem gradation: their weak stems end in -ṛ, their strong stems (as before,
used in NomVocAcc Du and Pl and NomVoc Pl) in either guṇa -ar or vṛddhi -ār. Their Loc Sg (!)
stands in guṇa.
Most ṛ-stems actually end in -tṛ (guṇa -tar, vṛddhi -tār). They consist of two semantic groups: one
group contains kinship terms, i.e. words denoting family relationships: मातृ- ‘mother’, पितृ- ‘father’,
दहित ु ृ- ‘daughter’, or भ्रातृ- ‘brother’. The -tṛ/-tar in these is directly related to the -ther or -ter in the
equivalent English words. The other, much larger group contains agent nouns. By taking a verbal
root in guṇa and adding -tṛ, we get nouns such as ने-तृ- ‘leader’ (from √नी ‘to lead’), कर्-तृ- ‘doer,
agent’ (from √कृ ‘to make, do’, e.g. in पाप-कर्तृ- ‘evil-doer’), लब्धृ- ‘taker’ (from √लभ् ‘to take’) etc.
(The same internal sandhi applies as before -t- elsewhere; –› Chapter 8 and the Reference Grammar
in Appendix III for details.) Some roots that end in consonants add not -tṛ, but -itṛ (as e.g. रक्षितृ-
‘protector’ from √रक् ‘to protect’); generally speaking, - ष् itṛ appears in those roots that also employ
-itum (rather than -tum) to form their infinitive.
Four of the kinship terms (मातृ- ‘mother’, पितृ- ‘father’, दहित ु ृ- ‘daughter’ and भ्रातृ- ‘brother’) as well
as नृ- ‘man’ behave as we might expect them to: their weak forms employ zero grade -tṛ, their
strong forms guṇa -tar. All other kinship terms, as well as all agent nouns, employ not guṇa -tar,
but vṛddhi -tār in their strong forms.

ṛ-stems: पित-ृ (m.) ‘father’, नेत-ृ (m.) ‘leader’.
The fields of strong cases are shaded.
Note:
– The Nom Sg has lost its final -r and ends in a long -ā in both types of ṛ-stems.
– AblGen Sg have an ending not encountered before, -uḥ.
– The Acc and Gen Pl both contain a long vocalic ṝ. Note that this is parallel to the long vowel in
e.g. a-stems (-ān and -ānām, respectively).
– Masculine and feminine ṛ-stems are declined identically, with the exception of the Acc Pl: while
the masculine forms end in -ṝn, feminines end in -ṝḥ; –› e.g. Acc Pl मातॄः ‘mothers’ (parallel to
ā/ī/ū-stems, whose Acc Pl is -āḥ, -īḥ, -ūḥ).
N-STEMS
There are two varieties of n-stems: an-stems and in-stems. They are all either Masc or Ntr, with the
Ntr differing from the Masc in NomVocAcc of all numbers.
an-stems are in effect greatly similar to regular (agent noun) ṛ-stems. Their endings overlap except
for Gen Sg and Acc and Gen Pl, where n-stems have the standard consonant-stem endings. As for
stem gradation, in their weak forms, they have zero grade -n-, and in their strong forms (again,
Masc NomVocAcc Sg and Du and NomVoc Pl, they have vṛddhi -ān-. Their Loc Sg can be guṇa or
zero grade. Their sandhi also is similar: between consonants, stem-final -n- turns into its vocalic
29
287
equivalent a (e.g. राजभिः, –› नेतभिृ ः; –› Chapter 7 on the development of nasals between consonants). Their Nom Sg Masc has lost its final -n and ends in -ā.
But note: where zero-grade n remains a consonant, it assimilates to a preceding consonant; specifically, -n- (the dental nasal) turns into the palatal nasal -ñ- when it is preceded by the palatal stop
-j- (e.g. AblGen Sg राज्ञः). Also, the weak forms of an-stems that end in a consonant plus one of the
suffixes -man- or -van- have guṇa rather than zero grade (see paradigm of आत्मन्- below).
Note that in cases whose endings begin with a consonant, these stems look identical to
a-stems, which may cause confusion. Make sure you remember that words such as कर्मन्-
etc. are n-stems, not a-stems.
in-stems are formally very similar to an-stems, but have different, simpler stem gradation: -in- surfaces as -in- before vowels, and as -i- before consonants. In the Nom Sg Masc, the ending is -ī, in
the Ntr it is -i (cf. the -ā/-a of an-stems).

29
288
-in can be added to both noun stems and verbal roots. When -in is added to a noun stem, the resulting word means ‘having (that noun)’: पक्षिन्- ‘bird’ literally means ‘having wings (पक्ष-)’; बलिन्-
means ‘having strength (बल-); strong’; वेदिन्- means ‘having knowledge (वेद-), knowing, wise’. One
of the words for elephant, हस्तिन्-, literally means ‘having a hand (हस्त-)’, referring to the elephant’s
most noticeable feature – the trunk – which it uses as a hand. Note that the final -a of a-stem nouns
is dropped before the -in.
-in added to a verbal root (which stands in either guṇa or vṛddhi) creates adjectives meaning ‘doing
(that verb)’; these can also be used like agent nouns: –› करिन्- or कारिन्- ‘doing’ or ‘doer, someone
who does’, from √कृ ‘to do’, or जयिन्- ‘winning, victorious’ from √जि ‘to win, conquer’.
Another kind of in-stem is formed by adding the suffix -vin, which has the same possessive meaning
as -vant-/-mant-, to a noun stem: –› तेजस्विन्- ‘having splendour; splendid, bright’, तपस्विन्- ‘(*having –›) practising austerities; ascetic’.
Feminines of in-stems add -ī to the stem and decline like regular ī-stems: –› बलिनी- ‘strong
(woman)’.

1 मातृ- ‘mother’, पितृ- ‘father’, दहित ु ृ- ‘daughter’; भ्रातृ- ‘brother’; नृ- ‘man’
-r Kinship terms: पितृ- ‘father’, or agent nouns (verbal root in guṇa plus -tar):
नेतृ- ‘leader’.
Note these endings: AblGen Sg -uḥ, Acc Pl Masc -ṝn, Fem -ṝḥ.
-n n-stems use regular consonant-stem endings.
in-stems: added to noun, meaning ‘having (that noun)’: पक्षिन्- ‘winged one, bird’;
or to a verbal root (in guṇa or vṛddhi): गामिन्- ‘going’.
Form feminines by adding -ī: बलिनी-, जयिनी-, तेजस्विनी- (–› Chapter 13 on ī-stems).
THE PERIPHRASTIC FUTURE
‘Periphrastic’ is a term here used to mean that one concept/idea is expressed by means of more
than one word. The periphrastic future consists of an agent noun ending in -tṛ combined with a
form of √अस् ‘to be’. नेतास्मि (< नेता अस्मि), for example, means ‘I will lead, am about to lead’. In the
1st and 2nd persons, the Nom Sg form of the agent noun (ending in -tā) is combined with the relevant form of √अस् ‘to be’ (they may be written together or separately, and either word may come
first). In the 3rd persons, the Nom of the respective number of the agent noun stands on its own.
Thus, नेता, नेतारौ and नेतारः mean ‘he will lead’, ‘the two will lead’ and ‘they will lead’, respectively.

2nd नेतासि नेतास्थः नेतास्थ
3rd नेता नेतारौ नेतारः
Periphrastic future of √नी
29
Translate the periphrastic future like the regular future. Although the third-person forms are simple agent nouns, their context allows us to keep the two categories (agent noun vs. future expression) apart. Also, the periphrastic future is often used together with adverbs of time such as श्वः
‘tomorrow’.
सत्यं वः प्रतिजानामि श्वो ऽस्मि हन्ता जयद्रथम्
‘The truth (सत्यं) I make known to you (वः): tomorrow I will kill Jayadratha.’
(Arjuna at Mahābhārata 7.73.20)
REVIEW QUESTIONS
1) Describe the two types of ṛ-stem. What are the differences between them in terms of form and
meaning?
2) What does the suffix -in- do?
3) Which ṛ-stem case endings differ from the regular consonant-stem endings?
4) Describe the formal difference between how stems of the type राजन्- and the type आत्मन्- are
declined.

नृप- or नृपति-); details of its irregular declension may be looked up in Whitney, A Sanskrit Grammar (§371). नृ- lies at the basis of the much more frequent नर-.

Notes: 2) उत्तिष्ठ and धारय are imperatives – किम् and धारय
each begin a new sentence. l.2 परा here ‘ultimate, final’.
3) Note the many bahuvrīhis, each standing in its

Secondary Middle Endings I: Thematic Verbs
Just as the active imperfect indicative and present potential use the same set of endings everywhere
except for the 1st Sg and the 3rd Pl (–› Chapter 12), so do their middle counterparts.
Middle imperfect indicatives and present potentials are also formed from the present tense stem,
and, again, the imperfect is marked by the augment a- added before the verbal stem, while the
potential marker -e- (originally: stem-final -a- + potential marker -ī- > -e-; –› Chapters 7 and 31)
appears at the end of the stem. Note that in the 2nd and 3rd Du, -i- (imperfect) and -(y)ā- (potential)
are unexpectedly added between stem and ending.
Singular Dual Plural
1st -i/-(y)a -vahi -mahi
2nd -thāḥ - thām -dhvam
3rd -ta - tām -(n)ta/-ran
Secondary middle endings
Passives are formed by adding these endings to the passive stem (–› Chapter 21). (They are rare,
though: past passives are usually expressed by means of ta-participles.)

LEXICAL NOTE: √युज्, युक्त-, योगThe verb √युज् basically means ‘to link’. It is related to the English word ‘yoke’, and can be used in
exactly this sense. Yet it is used far more widely, and specifically in instances where English would
employ a different verb. On the one hand, one may link things so that they fulfil a function they
cannot on their own: one arranges them, prepares them, makes them ready for something. On the
other, one may link things that belong to one another – yoke pairs of oxen, unite owners with their
possessions, honour a god with the worship (s)he deserves, pair a bow with an arrow, equip soldiers
with weapons, or ‘link’ the mind with the past (and thus remember it).
The past participle युक्त- has various specialised meanings that result from this basic idea of being
‘linked’: it may refer to material things linked to one another; it may refer to anyone engaged in or
occupied with something, and therefore experienced in it; on the level of (well-fitted) objects, it can
mean suitable or appropriate; when referring to the mind, it means concentrated or absorbed (e.g. in
meditation). The noun योग-, finally, also expresses any kind of ‘link’, including the ideas of ‘control
over’ and ‘focus on’.
So: remember the basic meaning of √युज् and forms derived from it, and when you encounter it
in a sentence, try to see in which exact notion it is used in that particular instance. (Again, this is
one of the basic techniques of translating in general, but it becomes the more important the more
‘flexibly’ a word is used.)
The term yoga became used to refer to one of the six ancient schools of Indian
philosophy, as defined in Patañjali’s Yoga Sūtras (composed at some point before the
fifth century AD). His ‘eight-limbed’ (aṣṭānga-) approach to yoga describes the eightfold
path towards (self-)control that ‘links’ the right action or the right mindset to a situation.
To calm the mind and realise what e.g. that right action is, the body equally needs to
be calm. The term ‘yoga’ as it is now used in the West refers mostly to haṭhayoga, a set
of focussed physical exercises, developed in India by the fifteenth century, that was
intended as preparation for such calming of the mind; yet traditional haṭhayoga is still
quite different from postural yoga as it is now practised in the West.

CHAPTER 31
Secondary Middle Endings II: Athematic Verbs
The secondary middle endings introduced in Chapter 30 are also used by athematic verbs. In the
middle, athematic verbs exclusively use the weak stem. Athematic imperfects again prefix the augment a- to their stem, yet athematic present potentials are marked by the addition of -ī- before the
ending (compare thematic -e-). Note that both the athematic Pres Pot and the Impf Ind use the 2nd
and 3rd Du endings -āthām and -ātām; yet the Pot adds -y- before them (as well as before the 1st Sg
-i). This keeps the potential marker -ī- recognisable throughout the paradigm.
Compare the following active and middle paradigms of √युज् (VII) ‘to link’.
Sg Du Pl Sg Du Pl
1st अयुञ्जि अयुञ्ज्वहि अयुञ्ज्महि युञ्जीय युञ्जीवहि युञ्जीमहि
2nd अयुङ्क्थाः अयुञ्जाथाम् अयुङ्ग्ध्वम् युञ्जीथाः युञ्जीयाथाम् युञ्जीध्वम्
3rd अयुङ्क्त अयुञ्जाताम् अयुञ्जत युञ्जीत युञ्जीयाताम् युञ्जीरन्
Impf Ind Mid of √युज् (VII) ‘to join’ Pres Pot Mid of √युज् (VII) ‘to join’
Note:
– In Class V verbs, stem-final -u- may drop in front of endings that begin with -v- or -m-, but only
if no more than one consonant precedes: –› 1st Du Impf Mid वृण्वहि or वृणुवहि, but only आप्नुवहि. The
suffix in Class IX verb stems appears as -nī- before consonants and -n- before vowels.
– The 3rd Pl Impf Mid ending -ata looks like a 3rd Sg; compare this to the 3rd Pl Pres Act of Class
III verbs (-ati instead of -anti in 3rd Pl forms elsewhere) and don’t let it confuse you.
Seeing that the athematic potential marker is -ī – allows us to recognise that the thematic
potential marker is the thematic vowel -a - + -ī - > -e -.

READING: Bhagavad-Gītā 1.1–4 – Introduction
The Bhagavad-Gītā is found at the onset of the major battle in the Mahābhārata (6.25–42). The
Pāṇḍava warrior Arjuna enters the battlefield and recognises numerous friends and relatives on the
opposing side: the battle is led on one side by the Pāṇḍavas, the five sons of Pāṇḍu, and on the other
the Kauravas, the 100 sons of king Dhṛtarāṣṭra, and Pāṇḍu and Dhṛtarāṣṭra are brothers. (All are
descendants of the mythical king Kuru, yet the term Kaurava (‘son/descendant of Kuru’ is here used
mainly to refer to just one line of his descendants, the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra). Not wanting to kill his own
family, Arjuna despondently sits down and asks Kṛṣṇa, who is his charioteer, what he ought to do.
Kṛṣṇa reminds him that he would kill only his opponents’ bodies, not their souls, and, as it is the soul
that matters, Arjuna must go ahead and fight, and thus fulfil his caste duties as a warrior. After asking
many more questions and pondering Kṛṣṇa’s answers, Arjuna is convinced, and the battle begins.
The Bhagavad-Gītā is told to king Dhṛtarāṣṭra, who is blind and therefore cannot observe what
is happening, by his servant Saṃjaya. As most of the text reports exactly what Kṛṣṇa is saying,
it is called Bhagavadgītā (short for Bhagavadgītā Upaniṣad, ‘the Upaniṣad (a foundational religious text) sung (gītā-, from √गै ‘to sing’, feminine to agree with upaniṣad- (f.)) by the bountiful
one (bhagavat-, ‘a way of referring to (a) god)’). Because in the framework of the Gītā, Saṃjaya
31
309
describes the events to Dhṛtarāṣṭra, we can read about them (or, in earlier times, listen to them
being retold by a bard); this is a popular literary device.

CHAPTER 32
Pronouns III: 1st- and 2nd-Person Pronouns
As in English, the 1st- and 2nd-person pronouns have one form for all genders: ‘I’, for example,
can be used both by a man and a woman to refer to themselves. The 1st-person pronoun lacks a
vocative (‘I’ cannot be addressed by someone), and the 2nd-person form lacks a regular distinction
between nominative and vocative: ‘you’ as in ‘you are nice’ could be seen as both nominative (it is
the subject of the sentence) and vocative (the subject is being addressed directly). Hence, there is
no vocative slot in the table below.
The paradigms of these two personal pronouns include a large number of new forms. Look them
over, and then use the notes below to help with memorisation.

अहम्

मम, मे आवयोः अस्माकम्, नः Gen तव, ते युवयोः युष्माकम्, वः
मयि अस्मासु Loc त्वयि युष्मासु
First person: अहम्/मत्- ‘I/the two of us/we, us’ Second person: त्वम्/त्वत्- ‘you/the two of you/you all’
Note:
– मत्- and त्वत्- are the stem forms of the respective pronouns (and as such are used e.g. in compounds –› Chapters 20, 22).
– The first- and second-person paradigms are almost completely parallel in their endings. Thus,
once one has been memorised, only the stems of the other remain to be studied. The exceptions
to this are the forms of the Gen Sg (first-person मम vs. second-person तव) and the Dat Sg (मह्यम्
vs. तुभ्यम्). Note also that -u- turns following -s- into -ṣ- according to ruki, giving us such pairs
as अस्मत but ् युष्मत.्
32 – The Dat Pl of both paradigms ends in -भ्यम्, not in +
-भ्यः.
– Do not confuse the 1st-person Pl forms with the singular forms अयम्/इदम्- (both begin with
asm-); specifically, be aware that अस्मत = 1 ् st-person Abl Pl, while अस्मात = ् Abl Sg of अयम्/इदम्-.
The Sanskrit forms are related to their English counterparts. Thus remember the 1st-Sg
pronoun (Nom अहम्, stem in other cases ma-) in reference to English ‘I’ and ‘me’. The
2nd-Sg stem tu- (tv- before vowels) is related to obsolete English forms such as thou. The
1st Pl Nom वयम्vayam (*ve-am) is related to English we, and the non-nominative stem
as(ma)- to English us. Compare 2nd Pl yū- and yu(ṣma)- to English you.
The short forms, so-called enclitics, listed after some cases (मे, नः etc.) are unstressed alternatives,
used whenever no particular emphasis lies on a pronoun. ‘He did this especially for us’ requires
अस्मभ्यम्, whereas e.g. ‘He (and not someone else) did this for us’, with no particular emphasis on
the ‘us’ may use नः. Not included in the table above are 1st-person नौ and 2nd-person वाम्, the enclitic
forms of the AccDatGen Du (note the unusual case combination).
While the standard greeting is नमस् (‘greetings/respect to you ते !’), prayers to a god may
well wish नमस्तुभ्यम् (‘respect to you!’).
Enclitics are unaccented, which has the effect that they cannot stand as the first word of
a sentence, but need to incline or ‘lean on’ a word that precedes them (hence their name).
We know that they do not have an accent because accents are marked in writing in the
oldest Sanskrit texts; and enclitics there appear without any accent marks.

READING: Bhagavad-Gītā 1.20–5: Arjuna enters the battlefield and sees who is on
the other side
This passage contains many epithets (terms used to describe characteristics of individuals, such
as गुडा-के श ‘thick-haired’ describing Arjuna). They are often used on their own – translate them
nominalised, e.g. as ‘the thick-haired one’.

सं जय उवाच
20) All nominatives refer to the same person,
Arjuna – the main verb for this verse is आह
in 21.1.
21) आह ‘he said’ (sth. (Acc) to sb. (Acc)) (3rd
Sg Perf) – महीपते addresses Dhṛtarāṣṭra.
l.2 The direct speech begins here – स्थापय
is the causative imperative of √स्था – मे is
dependent on रथं.
22) l.1 Continues 21 – split up यावद ए् तान् निरीक्षे
– यावद्here: ‘until, so that’. l.2 is a new
sentence – कै र् मया सह योद्धव्यम् lit. ‘by whom
must it be fought with me?’, translate active
as ‘with whom must I fight?’ (Gerundive
योद्धव्यम् –› Chapter 33).
23) l.1 योत्स्यमान- is a Fut Ptc – य is sandhied ये –
translate य एत as ‘they who’ – े धार्तराष्ट्र
स्य दर्बु ु द्धेर्
युद्धे is dependent on प्रियचिकीर्षवः; translate
these genitives as ‘for…’. l.2 the धार्तराष्ट्र
- here
is Duryodhana – Arjuna’s words end here,
even though there is no इति to mark that.
एवमुक्तो हृषीके शो गुडाके शेन भारत ।
सेनयोरुभयोर्मध्येस्थापयित्वा रथोत्तमम् ॥ १-२४॥
भीष्मद्रोणप्रमुखतः सर्वेषां च महीक्षिताम् ।
उवाच पार्थ पश्यैतान्समवेतान्कुरूनिति ॥ १-२५॥
24) l.1 Translate उक्तः as ‘spoken to, addressed’
– भारत addresses Dhṛtarāṣṭra (to whom this
story is told by Saṃjaya) – this sentence
continues up to उवाच in 25.2 – रथ-उत्तम-
‘highest of chariots’, i.e. ‘the chariot of the
leader’.
25) l.1 Both ‘Bhīṣma [and] Droṇa’ and the
two genitives are dependent on प्रमुखतः. l.2
split up पश्य एतान् –कु रु- here in the Pl: all
the descendants of Kuru (Kauravas and
Pāṇḍavas).

Desideratives and Gerundives
DESIDERATIVES
Sanskrit has desiderative verbs, adjectives and nouns. Just as a causative verb denotes ‘to cause
(someone) to do something’, a desiderative verb expresses ‘to desire/want to do something’.
Desiderative verbs are formed by:
– reduplicating the verbal root
– adding -sa- to it (sometimes -iṣa-, with -ṣ- due to ruki).
– adding an ending – if the basic verb is typically middle, the desiderative is likely to be middle,
too.
Consonants reduplicate according to the rules already known from perfects and Class III verbs (–›
Chapter 18, and the Reference Grammar in Appendix III). Vowels reduplicate as follows:
If the root contains u/ū, the reduplicative vowel is -u-:
√युध् ‘to fight’ –› युयुत्सत (with internal े sandhi: dh + s > -ts-) ‘he wants to fight’
√भू ‘to be’ –› बुभूषति (with internal sandhi: ū + s > -ūṣ-) ‘he wants to be’
If the root contains any other vowel, the reduplicative vowel is -i-:
√पा ‘to drink’ –› पिपासति ‘he wants to drink’
√भृ ‘to carry’ –› बिभरिषति ‘he wants to carry’
etc.
Roots usually, but not always, appear in zero grade before -sa- and often in guṇa before -iṣa-; yet
vṛddhi may also be found (–› e.g. जिघांसति ‘wants to kill’ from √हन् ‘to kill’; note that the h- in this
root appears as the underlying gh (–› Chapter 19) throughout the desiderative). Roots ending in a
short vowel may lengthen this final vowel (as in √श् ‘to listen, hear’ –› रु शुश्षति रू ‘he wants to hear’);
before -sa-, root-final ṛ turns into īr (as in √कृ ‘to do’ –› चिकीर्षति ‘he wants to do’).
33
317
Three relatively frequent forms whose verbal base cannot easily be inferred are:
- ईप्सति ‘wants to get’ or simply ‘wants’ from √आप् ‘to reach, obtain, get’
- दित्सति ‘wants to give’ from √दा ‘to give’
- धित्सति ‘wants to put’ from √धा ‘to put’
Desiderative verbs form periphrastic perfects, such as ईप्सयाम् आस ‘he wanted to get’ (–› Chapter 34).
Desiderative adjectives are formed from the stem of the corresponding desiderative verb by replacing the -a- of the sa-suffix with -u: युयुत्स- –› युयुत्-सु ‘desiring to fight’; चिकीर्ष- –› चिकीर्षु- ‘desiring/
willing to do/act’. They are declined like regular u-stem adjectives. To give an actual example:
पुरा देवयुगे… आदित्यो… आगच्छन्मानुषं
लोकं दिदृक्षुः
आदित्य- (m.) ‘the sun, the Sun (personified)’
पुरा (Indc) ‘long ago, in the past’
युग- (n.) ‘age, time’
‘A long time ago, in the age of the gods, Āditya came wanting to see the world of men/the
human world.’
(Mahābhārata 2.11.2)
Desiderative nouns replace the final -a of the desiderative verbal stem with an -ā. Their meaning
is always abstract: –› ईप्सा- ‘desire/wish to obtain sth.’, or शुश्षा- रू ‘desire to hear; obedience’. They
decline as regular ā-stems.
GERUNDIVES
Gerundives, like participles, are adjectives formed from verbal stems. They express the notion of
‘passive necessity’: the gerundive of to do means ‘having to be done’, the gerundive of to eat, ‘having
to be eaten’, and so on. Formally, gerundives consist of three elements:
a) the verbal root, often in guṇa, but both vṛddhi and zero grade are also found
b) one of the following suffixes: -ya- (-tya- after short vowels) or -tavya-; less frequently -anīyac) a case ending.
While the suffix -(t)ya- occurs most frequently, generally the form of a verb’s gerundive cannot be
predicted – neither what suffix it employs nor what root grade it stands in. The one mostly regular
correlation is that of a guṇa root with the suffix -tavya-. Several gerundives may be found of the
same verbal root. A few examples:
33
318
√कृ ‘to do, make’ –› कर्तव्य-, कार्य- ‘having to be done’
√श् ‘to listen, hear’ –› रु श्त्यरु -, श्रवणीय-, श्रावणीय- ‘having to be listened to, having to be obeyed’
Note:
- Roots ending in -ā change that -ā into -e before -ya-: e.g. √दा –› देय- ‘having to be given’.
- Gerundives are a-stems in the masculine and neuter, and ā-stems in the feminine.
- Gerundives negated with अ- express either ‘(that which) must not be x-ed’ (e.g. अ-कार्य- ‘which
is not to be done, improper’) or ‘(that which) cannot be x-ed’ (अ-दाह्य- ‘unburnable, which cannot be burnt’).
- The literal translation (‘having to be x-ed’) rarely ever makes for idiomatic English. Translation
of a gerundive by means of a relative clause may be sufficient (e.g. ‘the having-to-be-eaten food’
–› ‘the food that must be eaten’); yet, frequently, you should furthermore consider translating
a gerundive as an active verb (e.g. ‘I saw the having-to-be-eaten food’ –› ‘I saw the food that I
should eat’; ‘the having-to-be-defeated by us enemy’ –› ‘the enemy that we must defeat’).
Two examples:
सर्वे मुनयः कु शीलवौ प्रशस्तव्यौ प्रशशं सुः
lit. ‘all the seers praised (प्र-√शं स्) having-to-be-praised Kuśa and Lava (dvandva compound)’
–› ‘all the seers praised Kuśa and Lava who had to be praised/who were praiseworthy’
(based on Rāmāyaṇa 1.4.15)
कैर्मया सह योद्धव्यम् अस्मिन्रणसमुद्यमे
lit. ‘By whom must it be fought with me in this battle-undertaking?’
–› ‘Who must I fight with in this battle?’
(Bhagavad-Gītā 1.22)

CHAPTER 34
The Periphrastic Perfect; ta-participles Ending in -na
THE PERIPHRASTIC PERFECT
For two kinds of verb, Sanskrit uses an alternative, ‘periphrastic’ perfect formation:
1) ‘derived’ verbs, such as causatives (and by extension also some Class X verbs) and desideratives
2) some verbs with an initial long vowel.
The periphrastic perfect is formed as follows:
1) by taking the present stem, e.g. causative भारय- or ईक्ष2) adding -ām to give e.g. भारयाम् or ईक्षाम्
3a) for active forms, adding the required form of the perfect of √अस् ‘to be’ or, more rarely, √भू ‘to
be’ or √कृ ‘to do’:
√भृ ‘to carry’ –›भारयामास ‘I caused (someone) to carry’ (आस = 1st Sg Perf of √अस्)
–›भारयामासिम ‘we caused (someone) to carry’ (आसिम = 1st Pl Perf of
√अस्)
√ईक् ‘to see’ ष् –› ईक्षामासतुः ‘the two of them saw’
√आस् ‘to sit’ –› आसां चकार ‘he sat’
3b) for middle forms, adding the required form of the perfect middle of √कृ:
√आस् ‘to sit’ –› आसां चक्रे ‘I/he sat’
–› आसांचक्रिरे ‘they sat’
Basically, the periphrastic perfect is used whenever a regular perfect form would not be
sufficiently recognisable as a perfect. Causatives, for example, are made distinct from
the basic verb by the addition of -aya- to a root that is usually stronger than the root
in the equivalent basic verb form (–› e.g. basic भरति vs. causative भारयति). Yet perfects
are formed just from the root without any further suffixes, and their root grade depends
solely on which perfect form (singular or dual/plural, active or middle) is being used.
Thus, there is no way of formally distinguishing the perfects of a basic verb and the
34
323
corresponding causative verb: if causatives used the regular perfect, both e.g. basic भरत
and causative भारयत would have the perfect बभार. To be able to distinguish between the
two forms in the perfect, the alternative, periphrastic formation is used.
Verbs with an initial vowel reduplicate simply by reduplicating that vowel; e.g. √इष् ‘to
wish’ –› 3rd Pl ईषुः (i-iṣ-uḥ). If a reduplicative vowel is added to the beginning of the root
syllable, it merges with the root-initial vowel; but if that vowel is long to begin with, the
(reduplicated) perfect stem does not look different from the basic root: of √ईक्ष् ‘to see’,
the reduplicated root would be i-īkṣ- –› ईक्ष्-. The periphrastic construction offers the
possibility of a distinct perfect form, which is maybe why it came to be used in these
cases.
TA-PARTICIPLES ENDING IN -NA
Most verbs form their past participle by adding -ta. A few verbs add -na instead. The meaning of
both formations is identical. The -i- that sometimes appears before -ta is never found before -na.
Most of the roots taking -na end in -d (most frequent of these: √सद ‘to sit’ –›
् सन्न- ‘having sat’, and
thus ‘seated’, through internal sandhi from *sad-na-). A number end in a vowel:
– -ṛ, which then becomes -īr or -ūr (√स् ‘to strew, scatter’ –› तॄ स्तीर्ण- ‘(having been) scattered’, √तॄ
‘to cross’ –› तीर्ण- ‘having crossed’)
– more rarely -ā, -i or -u (frequent among these: √क्षि ‘to destroy’ –› क्षीण-, alternative to क्षित- ‘having been destroyed’)
One cannot predict which verbs have a past participle formed with -na rather than -ta. Remember
the relatively frequent forms सन्न- and स्तीर्ण- (especially as विस्तीर्ण- ‘spread out, large, great’), and
be prepared to identify other past participles ending in -na (or, through internal sandhi, -ṇa) for
what they are.

Perfect Participles; More Comparatives
PERFECT ACTIVE AND MIDDLE PARTICIPLES
Sanskrit forms both active and middle participles from the perfect stem.
1) The perfect middle participle adds the suffix -āna- (plus a-/ā-stem case endings) to the weak
perfect stem:
√युध् ‘to fight’ –› weak Perf stem युयुध्- –› Perf Mid Ptc युयुधान- ‘having fought’
√युज् (in the middle voice) ‘to link oneself, marry’ –› weak Perf stem युयुज्-
–› Perf Mid Ptc युयुजान- ‘having got married’
(Note: Perfect forms are always athematic, given that no suffix is added to the verbal root; hence
only -āna- is used, never -māna-.)
2) The perfect active participle is more complicated. Compare the following paradigm:

As usual, this participle consists of three elements: stem, suffix and endings. Two of these are
straightforward: the weak perfect stem is used throughout the paradigm, and we find regular consonant stem endings. Only the suffix employed in this participle is more complicated. Its regular
guṇa would be -vas-, yet it never appears in this form:
– It assumes vṛddhi and receives a nasal in the strong cases (-vāṃs-); in the NomVoc Sg, the final
consonant cluster (nasal plus s) is simplified by dropping the -s, thus giving -vān and -van, respectively.
– In those weak cases whose endings begin with a vowel, -vas- appears in zero grade -uṣ- (when
the guṇa -a- is dropped, v turns into u, which in turn changes the s into ṣ according to the ruki
rule: *vas –› *vs –› *us –› uṣ).
– In weak cases whose endings begin with a consonant, we find the suffix -vat-/-vad- rather than
a form of -vas-.
– -vat- also appears in the NomVocAcc Sg Ntr.
This may sound rather complicated, but the participle is easy to recognise due to the perfect stem
and the regular consonant-stem endings. It is used infrequently, and perhaps most often in विद्वस्-
from √विद ‘to see; know’.
् √विद lacks a reduplicative syllable both in the finite perfect forms (–› ् वेद
‘I know’) and in the participles; विद्वस्- means ‘knowing, skilled’ (developed from the underlying
meaning ‘having seen’, and thus now ‘knowing’). The perfect active participle is increasingly replaced by the tavant-participle (–› Chapter 25).
The feminine is formed by adding ī-stem endings to the weak participle stem, as in Nom Sg Fem
चक्रुषी (ca-kr-uṣ-ī).
COMPARATIVES IN -(Ī)YASThe regular comparative suffix -tara- was introduced in Chapter 9. Some adjectives also use the
suffix -yas- (or its alternative -(ī)yas-) to form their comparatives, and a small number use this
suffix exclusively. In this kind of comparative, the stem of the adjective often takes an unexpected
form. Generally speaking, any stem-forming suffix (such as -an, -in, -u, thematic -a and others)
is dropped; the remainder often appears in a higher grade than the basic adjective, or its vowel is
lengthened or nasalised. Thus प्रिय- ‘dear’ has a comparative प्रेयांस्- (with corresponding superlative प्रेष्ठ-), गुरु- ‘heavy; respectable’ has a comparative गरीयांस्-; the comparative that goes with the
already introduced श्रेष्ठ- ‘best’ is श्रेयांस्- ‘better, superior’.
The suffix undergoes stem gradation; its strong form -(ī)yāṃs- appears in NomVocAcc Sg and
Du and NomVoc Pl Masc (shortened in the NomVoc Sg to -(ī)-yān and -(ī)-yan, respectively);
the weak form -(ī)-yas- appears everywhere else. The feminine adds -ī- to the weak stem and is
35
declined like a regular ī-stem (giving e.g. श्रेयसी). The same sandhi as in other s-stem forms occurs
(as > o before voiced consonants, s > ḥ before -su).

CHAPTER 36
Absolute Constructions; Pronouns IV
LOCATIVE AND GENITIVE ABSOLUTE
The participle construction commonly referred to as the locative absolute consists of a noun or
pronoun and a participle that both stand in the locative case. It is best translated into English as a
temporal clause (introduced by ‘when’, ‘while’ or ‘after’), with the noun functioning as the subject
and the participle as the main verb.
गते तस्मिन् नरा उपाविशन्
‘when he had gone, the men sat down’ (lit. ‘at him having gone’)
उद्यति सूर्ये वनं प्रविशति
‘when the sun rises/at sunrise (उद-√इ ् ‘to go up, rise’), he enters the forest’ (lit. ‘at the
rising sun’)
The locative absolute is much more frequent than the similar genitive absolute, which consists of
a noun or pronoun and participle in the genitive case. While the locative absolute is usually to be
translated as a temporal clause, the genitive absolute may have purely temporal or also concessive
meaning (translated with ‘although’):
मैत्रवारुणिः समुद्रमपिबत् (…) सर्वलोकस्य पश्यतः
‘the son of Mitra and Varuṇa drained/drank up the ocean
       with the whole world looking on
       while the whole world was looking on
       although the whole world was looking on’
(Mahābhārata 3.103.3)

PRONOUNS IV: ENA- ‘THIS’
एन- ‘this’ is a demonstrative pronoun used only when there is no emphasis on that which the pronoun refers to. The paradigm of this pronoun is called defective, meaning incomplete, as only a few
forms are actually in use. They are the following:

ईश- (m.) ‘lord, master’
अप्सरस्- (f.) ‘heavenly nymph’
राक्षस- (m.) ‘demon’

HOW TO USE A SANSKRIT DICTIONARY
From this chapter on, you will need to use a Sanskrit dictionary. (See ‘Supplementary materials’ in
Chapter 0 for recommendations.)
Sanskrit dictionaries take a little while to get used to. The details of how the entries in a specific
dictionary are ordered, which abbreviations are employed etc. are outlined by each author, usually
on the first pages. Read them when you first use your dictionary, and remember where the relevant information may be looked up. This section outlines a few basic points that hold true across
dictionaries. For illustration of the points made below, look up entries such as √गम्, अश्व- or गुरु-.
Meaning: For a single Sanskrit word you may find a number of English translations. One of the reasons for this is that the meaning of many words changed over time, and Sanskrit dictionaries cover
literature that spans nearly two millennia; thus they include the various meanings that the word in
question has had. If a meaning is limited to a particular genre/period, the dictionary will indicate
this by abbreviations such as RV (Ṛgveda), V (the Vedas in general), B (the Brāhmaṇas), E (Epic), C
(Classical Sanskrit) etc. The ‘+’ symbol (as in ‘V+’) may be used to indicate that a meaning is found
from that time onwards. Use this information to help you narrow down the possible meanings of
a word in a given context: if you are reading something in Classical Sanskrit, you can rule out any
meanings marked as e.g. exclusively Vedic.
Verbs are listed in dictionaries by their roots. Thus, forms such as गच्छति or जगाम must both be
looked up under √गम्. The entry will tell you which class (or classes) a verb belongs to (some
change the way they are conjugated over time), whether it appears in the active, middle, or both,
and it will provide various forms that cannot be predicted from the shape of the root. In some
dictionaries, you will find an alphabetical list of preverbs together with which the verbal root is
used. This is where the meaning of each compound verb (verb itself plus preverb) is found. Other
dictionaries list compound verbs under their preverbs (i.e. ‘alphabetically’ under their first sound).
Compound nouns and adjectives are not always listed if their meaning is clear from that of the
words they are made up of. Yet even when they are listed, they frequently appear not in their own
entry, but within that of their first word (this is done to conserve space, and may be confusing
at first). Look at an entry for a frequent noun, and you will find sub-entries for nouns that are
preceded by a hyphen. This means that the information that follows (translation etc.) applies to
a compound of the main noun and the hyphenated noun. For example, an entry for अश्व- ‘horse’
may have a sub-entry ‘-tara’ (thus combine: अश्वतर-), meaning ‘mule’. Sometimes, the head noun
is itself a compound, in which case its members are divided by hyphens, and hyphenated words
within that entry have to be added to the first member of that compound, rather than the entire
compound. Thus in the following entry aśva-ttha- (note the hyphen!), the first sub-entry -da is to
36
337
be read not as +
aśva-ttha-da-, but as aśva-da- (which means ‘giving, providing horses’). (Cf. A. A.
Macdonell’s Practical Sanskrit Dictionary for these specific examples.)
Frequent sources of confusion:
– Dictionaries that offer transliteration may employ different conventions. Macdonell, for example, uses letters in italics to indicate palatals (thus, ‘k’ stands for ‘k’, yet italicised ‘k’ stands for
what this textbook writes as ‘c’) or retroflex sounds (thus, ‘t’ stands for ‘t’, yet ‘t’ stands for ‘ṭ’ in
this book).
– Placement of anusvāra ṃ and visarga ḥ: These two do not have a fixed position in the Sanskrit
order of characters. Thus, depending on which dictionary you use, you will find them in different places: either they are placed at the end of the list of vowels (and we find e.g. all words beginning with aṃ-, the vowel a- and the anusvāra listed before words beginning with ak-, that is,
a- and the first consonant of the ‘alphabet’). Yet, in some dictionaries, not all instances of vowel
plus visarga or anusvāra are found in one place. If the anusvāra stands in front of a stop to which
it can assimilate (and thus e.g. appear as a velar nasal ṅ before a velar stop such as k, or palatal ñ
in front of a palatal stop such as c, etc.), it is then listed where the ṅ appears in the alphabet. Similarly, visarga preceding a sibilant may itself turn into that sibilant (e.g. -ḥś- changing into -śś-)
and then be listed as that. What you need to do: in your dictionary, find where the author states
which methods they use; and if you cannot find such a statement, look in both of the places just
outlined. (Macdonell outlines his policy on p. ix of his Practical Sanskrit Dictionary; this book
uses the former policy, with all instances of ṃ and ḥ in one place.)
Most importantly: It is likely that the conventions of a Sanskrit dictionary will confuse you at first.
Don’t worry – this is normal, and will soon improve. Particularly in the beginning, if you cannot
find a word, assume you are looking in the wrong place, rather than that the word is not contained
in your dictionary. (Check whether you looked up a form with a short vowel rather than a long
vowel; an unaspirated rather than an aspirated consonant; ‘t’ rather than ‘ṭ/t’; a compound verb
under anything other than its root, etc.)

confused as to my duties’) are bahuvrīhis in the Nom Sg and refer to the subject, Arjuna –
split up यद श्् रेयः – ब्रुहि (‘say!’), शिष्यस् and शाधि (‘correct!’) each begin a new sentence – त्वाम् is

CHAPTER 37
Numerals
CARDINAL NUMBERS
Unlike in English, Sanskrit numerals (i.e. the words for numbers) have more than one form. The
words for one, two, three and four are adjectives with different forms for the different genders.
From five to ten, numerals behave like nouns in that they have different forms for the different
cases, but are the same regardless of the gender of the word they qualify.
The word for one, एक-, has already been introduced (–› Chapter 22). It appears in all three numbers. In the dual and plural, it needs to be translated as ‘some, a few’. The word for ‘two’ has forms
only in the dual; from ‘three’ up there are only plural forms. The citation forms (द्वि-, त्रि- etc.) are the
stem forms used in compounds, such as द्विपद-् ‘biped, two-footed’ or त्रिलोचन- ‘three-eyed’.

As you can see, the words for ‘five’, ‘seven’, ‘eight’, ‘nine’ and ‘ten’ decline in the same way, including
an endingless nominative shared by all. ‘Six’ employs the same endings, but the paradigm is slightly
complicated through the internal sandhi of the stem-final retroflex. ‘Eight’ has two sets of forms:
one formally comparable with that of the other numbers, and an older one ending in -au in the
Nom Sg and having a stem-final long ā (instead of short a) everywhere else. For higher numbers,
cf. e.g. Whitney, A Sanskrit Grammar (§§475–89).
ORDINAL NUMBERS
Ordinals are the terms referring to the order of numbers – first, second, third etc. In Sanskrit, they
all are a-stem adjectives in masculine and neuter, and ī-stems in the feminine.
प्रथम- ‘first’ षष्ठ- ‘sixth’
द्वितीय- ‘second’ सप्तम- ‘seventh’
तृतीय- ‘third’ अष्टम- ‘eighth’
चतुर्थ-, चतुरीय- ‘fourth’ नवम- ‘ninth’
पञ्चम- ‘fifth’ दशम- ‘tenth’
Look over the tables provided in this chapter, and memorise the stem and nominative(s) of all
cardinals, and the stem of all ordinals.

CHAPTER 38
Aorists
The aorist is another past tense. While originally the three past tenses – imperfect, perfect and aorist – differed from one another in meaning, this difference does not survive: they come to be used
interchangeably, with the aorist being rarest. Its most regular use is after मा to express prohibitions,
i.e. negated commands (see below).
There are seven different ways of forming the aorist. They are outlined here for reference purposes, and details (as well as middle forms) may be found e.g. in Whitney, A Sanskrit Grammar
(§§824–930). Aorist indicatives of all types use the augment a- and secondary endings (i.e. those
also found in the imperfect). They differ in how their stem is formed.
1.a)In the root aorist, augment and endings (1st Sg -am) are added to the root, which in different
verbs stands in different grades. It is limited to √भू and verbs ending in -ā.
1.b)The a-aorist adds augment and endings to a zero-grade root followed by -a-. Among aorist
formations, this one is rather frequent.
2) The reduplicated aorist reduplicates the root-initial consonant according to the known patterns, and vowels as follows: i is reduplicated as i/ī, u as u/ū, and a and ṛ as either i/ī or, more
rarely, a/ā. (If the root syllable is light (i.e. contains a short vowel followed by no more than one
consonant), the reduplicative vowel typically is long; if the root syllable is heavy, the reduplicative vowel typically is short.) The root itself stands in guṇa or zero grade, and an -a- is added
onto it. This aorist is usually formed of derived verbs (such as causatives).
3) Finally, there are a number of aorists formed by the addition of -s-/-ṣ- (the latter after ruki).
Internal sandhi frequently occurs in all aorists of this kind.
a) The s-aorist adds -s- onto the root. If the root ends in a vowel, it usually stands in vṛddhi
in the active, and in zero grade in the middle (yet roots ending in -ī/-ū stand in guṇa). If
it ends in a consonant, it has vṛddhi in the active, and zero grade in the middle.
b) In the rare iṣ-aorist, -iṣ- is added onto the root. If the root ends in a vowel, it stands in
vṛddhi in the active, and guṇa in the middle. If it ends in a consonant, it stands in guṇa
throughout.
c) The rare siṣ-aorist adds -siṣ- to the root in guṇa.
d) The sa-aorist, which is also rather infrequent, adds -sa- to the root in zero grade.
38
347
1a) √भू ‘to be’; 1b) √विद ‘to know’; 2) ् √जन् ‘to give birth’; 3a) √रुध् ‘to obstruct’; 3b) √बुध् ‘to understand’; 3c) √या ‘to go’; 3d) √दिश् ‘to show’.

3rd अभूवन् अविदन् अजीजनन् अरौत्सुः अबोधिषुः अयासिषुः अदिक्षन्
The types that are easiest to recognise – especially 1b), which looks very similar to imperfects
– are found most frequently. Know how types 1a and 1b are formed. Type 2) can be recognised
through its combination of augment and reduplication. Recognise aorists of type 3) by the s/ṣ in
their suffix.
In sum, to be able to recognise aorists, know that they have an augment (see immediately below for
an exception) and secondary endings; that their root may appear in any of the three grades and that
the root-final consonant may be affected by sandhi before s (devoicing, deaspiration, velarisation,
with possible retroflexion of the s to ṣ) in aorists formed by adding an -s-.
NEGATED COMMANDS AFTER मा
One way in which Sanskrit expresses negated commands (or ‘prohibitions’) is by means of मा +
unaugmented aorist. Thus, मा भूः means ‘don’t be’ (unaugmented root aorist of √भू); मा शुचः means
‘don’t mourn’ (unaugmented a-aorist of √शुच्). On other ways of forming negated commands

THE NUTSHELL
The aorist is another past tense, identical in meaning to imperfect and perfect. If you find a
verb form employing the augment, secondary endings and a stem other than the present stem
(–› Impf), you know it is an aorist .
मा + unaugmented aorist expresses a negated command: e.g. मा शुचः ‘don’t mourn!’

Pronouns V: asau/adasअसौ/अदस्- ‘THAT’
This is another pronoun that means ‘this’ or ‘that’ (असौ is its Nom Sg Masc, अदस्- its Nom Sg Ntr
and stem form). When contrasted with अयम्/इदम्- (Chapter 20), अयम्/इदम्- expresses ‘this (closer) one’, it refers to ‘that one (further away)’. This paradigm is more difficult to memorise due to the
large number of different stems. Also, it is used more rarely than अयम्/इदम्-, and is thus given here
mainly for reference purposes.

The best way of familiarising yourself with this paradigm is the following: the endings outside of
the NomAcc are recognisable. Thus memorise the NomAcc of all numbers and genders, and the
different stems that appear in this paradigm (amu-, amuṣ- (both genders), amī- (Masc Pl), amū-
(Du of both genders, Fem Pl)). This will enable you to identify the various parts of this paradigm
when you encounter them in a text.

agree with -गतिम् (Acc Sg Fem) – जन्म-कर्म-फल-प्रद- ‘offering (re)birth as the fruit of action’.
l.2 क्रिया-विशेष- ‘variety of rites’ – भोग-ऐश्वर्य-गति- ‘path towards pleasure and power’ – प्रति
‘concerning, regarding’; translate here ‘(these people) are concerned with…’.
भोगैश्वर्यप्रसक्तानां तयापहृतचेतसाम् ।
व्यवसायात्मिका बुद्धिः समाधौ न विधीयते ॥ २- ४४॥
44) प्रासक्त- ‘attached to’ – split up तया अपहृत-चेतसाम् – तया ‘by this’ refers to the views and
discussions of Veda-followers. l.2 व्यवसाय-आत्मिका बुद्धिः समाधौ ‘understanding in/through
meditation whose nature is resolved, that is characterised by resolve’ – the two genitives are
the indirect objects of विधीयत (‘it is put to/given to े …’).

त्रैगुण्यविषया वेदा निस्तगु्रै ण्यो भवार्जुन ।
निर्द्वन्द्वो नित्यसत्त्वस्थो निर्योगक्म आषे त्मवान् ॥ २- ४५॥
45) त्रै-गुण्य-विषय- ‘having as territory/scope the three “qualities”’, i.e. concerned with the three
fundamental character traits (sattva (~ ‘balance’ or ‘purity’), rajas (~ ‘activity’ or ‘emotion’),
tamas (~ ‘inertia’ or ‘lethargy’)), a basic set of categories in sāṃkhya philosophy –वेदाः ‘the
Vedas’, i.e. the earlier religious texts – these two words make up a complete sentence – निस्-
त्रै-गुण्य- ‘without the three guṇas’, i.e. not concerned with them, but rather with what is
outlined next. l.2 निर्-द्वन्द्व- lit. ‘without pairs’, i.e. ‘not concerned with pairs of opposites’ (as
they occur in the natural world) – नित्य-सत्त्य-स्थ- ‘eternally standing in/steadfast towards the
truth’ – निर्-योग-क्म-षे ‘without (i.e. unconcerned with) yoga and comfort’; yoga (lit. any kind
of ‘link’ (√युज्)) (see note on yoga in Chapter 30) has a very broad meaning and may refer to a
variety of things; here it is perhaps to be understood as ‘link to possession’, i.e. ‘gain; wealth’ –
आत्मावत here ‘concentrating on the self, mainly paying attention to the self ’. ्
यावानर्थ उदपाने सर्वतः संप्लुतोदके ।
तावान्सर्वेषु वेदेषु ब्राह्मणस्य विजानतः ॥ २- ४६॥
46) यावान्… तावान् ‘as much… so much’, read अर्थः ‘purpose, use’ with both – संप्लुत-उदक- ‘in/
amidst overflowing water’. l.2 translate the last two genitives as ‘for…’.
कर्मण्येवाधिकारस् मा फलेषु कदा चन ते ।
मा कर्मफलहेतुर्भूर्माते सङ्गो ऽस्त्वकर्मणि ॥ २- ४७॥
47) Split up कर्मणि एव अधिकारस् त, supply ‘is’ or ‘should be’ े – एव ‘only’ – अधिकार- ‘right, claim
to’ (+ Loc) – मा भूः ‘don’t be’ (–› Chapter 38) – हेतु- ‘motivation, cause, reason’ – मा अस्तु
‘there must not be’ (negated imperative with मा + 3rd Sg Impv) – सङ्ग- ‘attachment to’ + Loc –
out of three possibilities (action – regard for the fruit of the action rather than the action
itself – inaction, laziness), we should choose only the first.
योगस्थः कु रु कर्माणि सङ्गंत्यक्त्वा धनंजय ।
सिद्ध्यसिद्ध्योः समो भूत्वा समत्वं योग उच्यते ॥ २- ४८॥
48) From here on, translate योग- as ‘yoga’ – धनं-जय- ‘conqueror of wealth’ (referring to Arjuna) –
सम-, समत्व- ‘same’, ‘sameness’, i.e. ‘indifferent’, ‘indifference’ – समत्वं begins a new sentence –
उच्यत ‘is said to be े …’.
39
355
दूरेण ह्यवरं कर्म बुद्धियोगाद्धनंजय ।
बुद्धौ शरणमन्विच्छ कृ पणाः फलहेतवः ॥ २- ४९॥
49) दूरेण ‘by far, by much’ – अ-वर- ‘not choice’, i.e. ‘not preferable to’ (+ Abl) – बुद्धि-योग- ‘the
yoga of understanding’, as opposed to कर्म(योग)-, ‘(the yoga of) action’, that has just been
described – बुद्धौ begins a new sentence – अनु-√इष् ‘to seek’ – कृ पनाः फलहेतवः is a new
sentence; supply ‘are’ – note that we here find a third approach introduced: the views of
Sāṃkhya were discussed first – then karmayoga – now buddhiyoga.
बुद्धियुक्तो जहातीह उभे सुकृतदष्ु कृते ।
तस्माद्योगाय युज्यस्व योगः कर्मसु कौशलम् ॥ २- ५०॥
50) युक्त- here ‘disciplined, focussed’ – √हा ‘to abandon, leave behind’ – इह ‘here, in this world’
– √युज् (Mid, + Dat) ‘link yourself to’ – योगः कर्मसु कौशलम् is a new sentence; supply ‘is’.
कर्मजं बुद्धियुक्ता हि फलं त्यक्त्वा मनीषिणः ।
जन्मबन्धविनिर्मुक्ताः पदं गच्छन्त्यनामयम् ॥ २- ५१॥
51) कर्म-ज- ‘born from/the result of action’ – निविर्मुक्त- ‘free(d) from’ – पद- here ‘place’.
यदा ते मोहकलिलं बुद्धिर्व्यतितरिष्यति ।
तदा गन्तासि निर्वेदं श्रोतव्यस्य श्रुतस्य च ॥ २- ५२॥
52) त is dependent on े बुद्धिः – मोहकलिल- ‘thicket of delusion’ – वि-अति-√तॄ ‘to cross beyond,
leave behind’ – गन्तासि periphrastic future (–› Chapter 29) – निर्वेद- ‘disregard, disgust’ –
श्रुत- ‘having been heard’ (older teachings in general, and alluding to the Vedas, also referred
to as श्ति- रु because they have been ‘heard’ by, i.e. divinely revealed to, certain sages).
श्तिरु विप्रतिपन्ना ते यदा स्थास्यति निश्चला ।
समाधावचला बुद्धिस्तदा योगमवाप्स्यसि ॥ २- ५३॥
53) Structure: यदा ते बुद्धिः स्थास्यति… तदा – the various Nom Sg Fem forms all agree with बुद्धि- –
श्तिरु विप्रतिपन्न- ‘leaving behind, disagreeing with received doctrine (श्ति- रु , lit. ‘hearing’; see
above)’ – समाधि- ‘meditation, concentration’, split up समाधौ अचला.

अर्जुन उवाच
स्थितप्रज्ञस्य का भाषा समाधिस्थस्य के शव ।
स्थितधीः किं प्रभाषेत किमासीत व्रजेत किम् ॥ २- ५४॥
54) स्थित-प्रज्ञ- ‘whose understanding stands/is firm’ – के शव- ‘haired one, having thick/long hair’,
addressing Kṛṣṇa – for स्थित-धी-, –› स्थित-प्रज्ञ- – किम् here ‘in what way, how?’.
श्रीभगवानुवाच
प्रजहाति यदा कामान्सर्वान्पार्थ मनोगतान् ।
आत्मन्येवात्मना तुष्टः स्थितप्रज्ञस्तदोच्यते ॥ २- ५५॥
55) Structure यदा प्रजहाति… तदा स्थितप्रज्ञ उच्यते – प्र-√हा (III) ‘to leave behind’ – मनोगत- ‘come
from the mind, created by the mind’ – split up आत्मनि एव आत्मना.
दःखे ु ष्वनुद्विग्नमनाः सुखेषु विगतस्पृहः ।
वीतरागभयक्रोधः स्थितधीर्मुनिरुच्यते ॥ २- ५६॥
56) अनुद्विग्न- ‘not confused, not agitated’ – विगत- ‘having left, being gone’ – वीत- (वि-इत-) ‘having
gone away’ – राग- here ‘desire, passion’ – उच्यत ‘is called’. े

CHAPTER 40
Some Irregular Nouns
Below are the paradigms of four nouns that employ regular consonant-stem endings (and in a few
cases vowel-stem alternatives). They all have stem gradation, and the cases one would expect to
be strong are so (NomVocAcc Sg and Du, NomVoc Pl) and the rest weak; yet they alternate either
between vṛddhi and guṇa (1, 2) or vṛddhi and zero grade (3, and in a sense 4).
गो- ‘BULL’; ‘COW’
गो- may be masculine (and thus have masculine adjectives or pronouns referring to it) and mean
‘bull’; or it may be feminine and mean ‘cow’. Its strong stem stands in vṛddhi (gau- = gāv- before
vowels), its weak stem in guṇa (go- = gav- before vowels). Yet note two unexpected forms: in the
Acc Sg, the -u- is dropped, resulting in गाम्; and its Acc Pl is गाः.

द्यो- ‘SKY’
This noun shows the same stem variation as गो- – vṛddhi in the strong cases (-au- before consonants, -āv- before vowels), guṇa in the weak cases (-o- before consonants, -av- before vowels), and
a dropped -u- in the Acc Sg द्याम्. Finally, note the Acc Pl द्यू
न्. There is also a parallel paradigm that
40
358
simply has zero-grade in all forms except for the NomVoc Sg (these appear as div- before vowels
and dyu- before consonants). This second, more regular paradigm is actually more frequent in
Classical Sanskrit.

The old paradigm The zero-grade paradigm
पथ्- ‘PATH’
The strong forms of this noun are doubly marked. Not only do we find the guṇa of the stem (panth-,
as opposed to zero-grade path- in the weak forms), but we also find a suffix (-ān-) that is absent
in the weak cases. Hence, the Acc Sg is panth-ān-am, while the Acc Pl is path-ø-aḥ. The Nom Sg
does not have the 2nd nasal, and its ending appears just as -āḥ. In weak cases whose ending begins
with a consonant, an -i- appears between the weak stem and the ending, giving us path-i-bhiḥ etc.

पुंस्- ‘MAN’
This noun has three stems: strong pumāṃs- and weak puṃs-, which before consonants appears as
pum-. The Nom Sg has no final -s, and the Voc Sg has two possible forms.

These words are rather infrequent. In order to familiarise yourself with these paradigms, remember what kind of alteration of stem grades each one has; then focus on the forms that are unexpected within those patterns (see the Nutshell below).
THE NUTSHELL

गो- ‘bull; cow’ vṛddhi गौ- guṇa गो- Acc Sg, Acc Pl
द्यो- ‘sky’ (vṛddhi द्यौ-) (guṇa द्यो-/ द्यव्-)

More frequent: alternative zero-grade
weak forms (द्यु

in NomVoc Sg
पथ्- ‘path’ guṇa root plus

READING: Bhagavad-Gītā 2.57–72 – Free yourself from attachment to the material
world
यः सर्वत्रानभिस्हनेस्तत्तत्प्राप्य शुभाशुभम् ।
नाभिनन्दति न द्वेष्टि तस्य प्रज्ञा प्रतिष्ठिता ॥ २- ५७॥
57) Structure यः… तस्य – split up सर्वत्र अन्-अभिस्हस् ने ‘without attachment/desire all around’
– तत्तत ‘this or that; whatever’ – split up ् शुभ-अशुभ- ‘a good or a bad thing’ – प्रतिष्ठित-
‘standing’, i.e. ‘solid, firm’.
यदा सं हरते चायं कूर्मो ऽङ्गानीव सर्वशः ।
इन्द्रियाणीन्द्रियार्थेभ्यस्तस्य प्रज्ञा प्रतिष्ठिता ॥ २- ५८॥
58) Structure: अयम्… तस्य – चायं = च अयं – सर्वशः ‘entirely’ – split up कूर्मः अङ्गानि इव (सं हरते) –
इन्द्रिय-अर्थ- ‘object of the senses’.
विषया विनिवर्तन्तेनिराहारस्य देहिनः ।
रसवर्जं रसो ऽप्यस्य परं दृष्ट्वा निवर्तते ॥ २- ५९॥
59) विषय- ‘sense object’ (also in the following verses) – वि-नि-√वृत् ‘to turn away from’ + Gen –
निर्-आहार- ‘without food’, i.e. ‘fasting’ – रस-वर्जं(Indc) ‘taste excepted, with the exception of
taste’* – रसो ऽपि ‘and even taste’ begins a new sentence – पर- ‘the highest, the supreme, the
beyond’ (i.e. ultimate understanding? god?).
* ‘Taste’ may either be understood literally (as the sense impression related to food, the most basic of our needs), or in a more general sense as the impression the sense objects leave on us: even
when they do not concern us any more, their memory lingers – but once we have experienced
‘the highest’, even the memories of the sense objects fade/pale in comparison. At any rate, this
passage is subject to various interpretations.
यततो ह्यपि कौन्तेय पुरुषस्य विपश्चितः ।
इन्द्रियाणि प्रमाथीनि हरन्ति प्रसभं मनः ॥ २- ६०॥
60) √यत ‘to strive’ ् – हरन्ति मनः ‘take away the mind’, i.e. take control of it – प्रसभम् (Indc)
‘violently, forcibly’.
40
362
तानि सर्वाणि सं यम्य युक्त आसीत मत्परः ।
वशे हि यस्येन्द्रियाणि तस्य प्रज्ञा प्रतिष्ठिता ॥ २- ६१॥
61) With तानि सर्वानि, supply इन्द्रियाणि – युक्त- ‘focussed, concentrated’ – √आस् (II Mid) ‘to sit’
– मत्पर- ‘with me as highest’, i.e. focusing on me (Kṛṣṇa/Viṣṇu). l.2 begins new sentence –
supply ‘are’ with इन्द्रियाणि.
ध्यायतो विषयान्पुंसः सङ्गस्षूपजाय ते ते ।
सङ्गात्संजायते कामः कामात्क्रोधो ऽभिजायते ॥ २- ६२॥
62) ध्यायत्- Pres Act Ptc of √ध्या ‘to think, ponder’ – the genitives in the first line are dependent
on सङ्ग- (+ Loc) ‘attachment to’ – तेषु refers to विषयान् – translate all compounds of √जन् in
the same way.
क्रोधाद्भवति सं मोहः सं मोहात्स्तिमृ विभ्रमः ।
स्मृतिभ्रंशाद्बुद्धिनाशो बुद्धिनाशात्प्रणश्यति ॥ २- ६३॥
63) स्मृति-विभ्रम- ‘memory-wandering’, i.e. memories led astray, incorrect memory – भ्रंश-
‘wandering, trailing off/away’ – the subject of प्रणश्यति is ‘he’ (the person the preceding lines
had described).
रागद्वेषवियुक्तैस्तुविषयानिन्द्रियैश्चरन् ।
आत्मवश्यैर्विधेयात्मा प्रसादमधिगच्छति ॥ २- ६४॥
64) वियुक्त- lit. ‘unjoined’, i.e. ‘freed from’ – चरन् translate ‘even if he considers’ (lit. ‘moving (in
his mind)’) – आत्मवश्य- ‘self-restrained, restrained by themselves’ – विधेय-आत्मन्- ‘whose
self is controlled’.
प्रसादे सर्वदःखानां हा ु निरस्योपजायते ।
प्रसन्नचेतसो ह्याशु बुद्धिः पर्यवतिष्ठते ॥ २- ६५॥
65) हानि- (f.) ‘ceasing, end’ – translate अस्य as ‘for him’ – आशु (Indc) ‘straight away, immediately’
– परि-अव-√स्था ‘to stand firm, steady’ – Note: Both प्रसाद- and प्रसन्न- derive from प्र-√सद.
्
नास्ति बुद्धिरयुक्तस्य न चायुक्तस्य भावना ।
न चाभावयतः शान्तिरशान्तस्य कुतः सुखम् ॥ २- ६६॥
66) अयुक्त- ‘undisciplined’ – भावना- (f.) ‘reflection, contemplation’ – अभावयत्- ‘unfocussed’ –
अशान्त- ‘without peace’ – ‘of X is’ = ‘X has’.
40
363
इन्द्रियाणां हि चरतां यन्मनो ऽनुविधीयते ।
तदस्य हरति प्रज्ञां वायुर्नावमिवाम्भसि ॥ २- ६७॥
67) Translate यद…् तद as ‘when ् … then’ – अनु-वि-√धा in passive ‘to be guided, led by’
(+ Gen) – √हृ ‘to take away, take control of ’ (+ Acc) – नावम्Acc Sg of नौ- ‘ship’.
तस्माद्यस्य महाबाहो निगृहीतानि सर्वशः ।
इन्द्रियाणीन्द्रियार्थेभ्यस्तस्य प्रज्ञा प्रतिष्ठिता ॥ २- ६८॥
68) महाबाहु- again ‘great-armed (one)’ – निगृहीत- Ptc of नि-√ग्रह् ‘to hold back, take away’ – split
up इन्द्रियाणि इन्द्रियार्थेभ्यः.
या निशा सर्वभूतानां तस्यां जागर्ति सं यमी ।
यस्यां जाग्रति भूतानि सा निशा पश्यतो मुनेः ॥ २- ६९॥
69) Structure: या… तस्याम्, यस्याम्… सा – supply ‘is’ in the या and सा clauses – √जागृ (II जागर्ति)
‘to be awake, wide awake’ – सं यमिन्- ‘holding together; one who holds together, restrains (i.e.
his senses)’ – सा निशा पश्यतो मुनेः it is night for him, maybe because he does not pay attention
to sense impressions (visible during the day) any more, or maybe because they blind him?
आपूर्यमाणमचलप्रतिष्ठं समुद्रमापः प्रविशन्ति यद्वत् ।
तद्वत्कामा यं प्रविशन्ति सर्वे स शान्तिमाप्नोति न कामकामी ॥ २- ७०॥
70) यद्वत…् तद्वत ‘in the same way ् … as’ – आ-√पॄ ‘to fill’ – अ-चल-प्र-तिष्ठ- ‘standing unmoved’ –
link the first two words with ‘but’ or ‘and yet’; both qualify समुद्रम् –आपः ‘the waters’ (Nom
Pl). l.2 Note the यं… स… within the तद्वत-clause – supply ‘but who remains ् unmoved’ – न
कामकामी is a new sentence; read ‘the desire-desirer (who is focussing on/controlled by his
desires? who enjoys desires? who desires his desires to be fulfilled? who desires desire/
pleasure (possible sexual connotation)?) [does] not’.
विहाय कामान्यः सर्वान् पुमांश्चरति निःस्पृहः ।
निर्ममो निरहंकारः स शान्तिमधिगच्छति ॥ २- ७१॥
71) वि-√हा ‘to leave behind’ – निःस्पृह- ‘free from longing’ – निर्-मम- lit. ‘free from “mine!”’,
i.e. ‘not caring about possessions’ – निर्-अहंकार- lit. ‘free from “I am doing (this)!”’, i.e.
‘unselfish’.
40
364
एषा ब्राह्मी स्थितिः पार्थ नैनां प्राप्य विमुह्यति ।
स्थित्वास्यामन्तकाले ऽपि ब्रह्मनिर्वाणमृच्छति ॥ २- ७२॥
72) ब्राह्मी स्थितिः ‘the position of/relating to Brahman (the cosmic spirit)’ – न begins a new
sentence; it negates विमुह्यति – स्थित्वा ‘standing’, i.e. ‘standing firm, securely’ – अस्याम् refers to
स्थितिः – ब्रह्म-निर्वाण- lit. ‘the nirvāṇa (state of ultimate liberation from the material world) of
brahman (the cosmic spirit, the ultimate reality)’ (tatpuruṣa) or ‘the nirvāṇa that is brahman’ (karmadhāraya); the exact difference between this and ‘normal’ nirvāṇa is a matter of
discussion – ऋच्छति 3rd Sg Act of √अर् ‘to come to, to reach’.

svaraḥ (‘sound, voice’) vowel – vyañjanaḥ (‘manifestation’) consonant – akṣaram ‘syllable, character’ is the equivalent to our ‘letter’ (the basic unit representing a complete syllable rather than just
one sound, as it would in Latin writing); a syllable can be laghu- ‘light’ or guru- ‘heavy’ – vowels
can appear in zero grade (for which there is no native Indian name), guṇa (full grade) or vṛddhi
(lengthened/extended grade) – saṃdhiḥ (putting (√dhā) together sam-).
Nouns
Noun nāman – genders puṃliṅgam (‘man sign’) masculine, strīliṅgam (‘woman sign’) feminine,
napuṃsakaliṅgam (‘not person sign’) neuter – numbers ekavacanam (‘one-word’) singular, dvivacanam (‘two-word’) dual, bahuvacanam (‘many-word’) plural – cases prathamā [vibhaktiḥ] (‘first
[part/inflection]’) nominative, dvitīyā (‘second’) accusative, tṛṭīyā (‘third’) instrumental, caturthī (‘fourth’) dative, pañcamī (‘fifth’) ablative, ṣaṣṭhī (‘sixth’) genitive, saptamī (‘seventh’) locative.
Nominal compounds: samāsaḥ (‘combination, union’) compound; vigrahaḥ (‘taking apart’) analysis of compounds – for the various types of compound –› Chapter 14.
Verbs
Verb/verbal root: dhātuḥ (‘essential ingredient, element’) – verb stem: aṅgaḥ (‘limb’) – verb
class: gaṇaḥ (‘group’)– numbers see above – persons uttamaḥ [puruṣaḥ] (‘last’(!)’) first [person],

forms is 3rd Sg, Du, Pl, 2nd Sg, Du, Pl, 1st Sg, Du, Pl) – voices: parasmaipadaḥ (‘word for another’) active, ātmanepadaḥ (‘word for oneself ’) middle, karmaṇi prayoga (‘focus on the thing done’)
passive (this term is quite rarely used) – verbs that appear in both active and middle (without any
distinction in meaning) are called ubhayapadaḥ (‘both-word’) – tenses: vartamāna (‘ongoing’)

SANSKRIT METRE: A BRIEF INTRODUCTION
Sanskrit, like English, has prose and verse texts. These two text types are distinguished by the
amount of formal constraints on them: while a polished prose text has balance and an overall
rhythm, a verse text has lines and stanzas that may consist of specific numbers of syllables or certain
sequences of stressed and unstressed syllables (or, in Sanskrit, heavy and light syllables), thereby
creating a variety of specific rhythms, that may contain rhymes; or it may have all of these features.
Below are two English passages, one of prose, one of verse. Notice how, while the prose passage is
well structured and has a certain ebb and flow to it, the verse passage follows much stricter rules:
only one specific pattern of rhyme, rhythm and number of lines makes a sonnet a sonnet.
Women have burnt like beacons in all the works of all the poets from the beginning of time.
Indeed if woman had no existence save in the fiction written by men, one would imagine
her a person of the utmost importance; very various; heroic and mean; splendid and sordid;
beautiful and hideous in the extreme; as great as a man, some would say greater. But this
is woman in fiction. In fact, as Professor Trevelyan [a British historian] points out, she was
locked up, beaten and flung about the room. A very queer, composite being thus emerges.
Imaginatively she is of the highest importance; practically she is completely insignificant.
She pervades poetry from cover to cover; she is all but absent from history. She dominates
the lives of kings and conquerors in fiction; in fact she was the slave of any boy whose parents forced a ring upon her finger. Some of the most inspired words and profound thoughts
in literature fall from her lips; in real life she could hardly read; scarcely spell; and was the
property of her husband.
(Virginia Woolf, A Room of One’s Own)
Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,
The dear repose for limbs with travel tired;
But then begins a journey in my head
To work my mind, when body’s work’s expired:
For then my thoughts – from far where I abide –
Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,
And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,
Looking on darkness which the blind do see:
Save that my soul’s imaginary sight
Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,
Which, like a jewel hung in ghastly night,
Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.
376
II
Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,
For thee, and for myself, no quiet find.
(William Shakespeare, Sonnet 27)
Sanskrit metrical texts are written in stanzas (padyas) which consist of four parts (pādas). All four
pādas can be the same, alternate pādas (1+3 and 2+4) can be the same, or all four pādas can be
different. Most pādas (and thus the stanzas made up of them) are classified by how many syllables
(akṣaras) they contain and in what order of light (laghu) and heavy (guru) those are arranged (–›
Chapter 2a on the laghu/guru distinction). Stanzas consisting of such pādas are called vṛttas. (The
rarer alternative, so-called jātis, are defined by the number of mātras they contain, with a short
vowel counting as one mātra and a long vowel or diphthong as two.)
The shortest and probably simplest metre is the kanyā, which consists of four identical pādas of
four heavy syllables each.
भास्वत्कन्या सैका धन्या । – – – – – – – –
यस्याः कू ले कृ ष्णो ऽखेलत् ॥ – – – – – – – –
‘The radiant girl is fortunate in whose family Kṛṣṇa played.’
When looking at a Sanskrit text, the way to determine what metre it stands in is the following:
1) Split up each pāda into sequences of three syllables each; if one or two syllables remain, leave
them as they are. Mark what combination of syllable quantities they consist of: light, light,
heavy? Heavy, light, heavy (etc.)?
2) Using the mnemonic yamātārājabhānasalagā, assign labels to these syllable triplets. This mnemonic contains any combination of three short or long syllables possible – the first three syllables yamātā are light-heavy-heavy, syllables 2–4 mātārā are heavy-heavy-heavy, syllables 3–5
tārāja are heavy-heavy-light; and so on. Each triplet is named after its first syllable: yamātā is
‘ya’, mātārā is ‘ma’, etc. A single leftover syllable is called ‘la’ if it is light, and ‘ga’ if it is heavy.
3) Using a list of Sanskrit metres (such as that contained at the end of V. S. Apte’s Practical Sanskrit–English Dictionary, available either in printed form or as a pdf downloadable online:
google ‘apte Sanskrit dictionary’; if you have too many hits, select ‘pdf ’ as the file type), identify
the metre you are looking at.
For example:
निन्दन्तु नीतिनिपुणा यदि वा स्वतुन्तु Let the clever blame or praise,
लक्ष्मीः समाविशतु गच्छतु वा यथेष्ठम् Let Fortune come or go as she wants,
अद्यैव वा मरणमस् युगा तु न्तरेव Let death come right now or at the end of time,
न्यायात्पथः प्रविचलन्ति पदं न धीराः The wise do not move their foot away from the right path.
377
II
If you count, you find that each of the four lines has fourteen syllables, and each follows this
pattern:
–– ˘ – ˘ ˘ ˘ – ˘ ˘ – ˘ ––  (– marks a heavy syllable, ˘ a light one)
Split these up into triplets and you arrive at:
––˘ –˘˘ ˘–˘ ˘–˘ – –
Identifying these according to yamātārājabhānasalagā, we thus have:
ta  ya  ra  ra  ga  ga
When we now look in a list of metres, we first need to go to the ones with fourteen syllables per
pāda; there, we need to find ta bha ja ja ga ga. This lets us identify this stanza as vasantatilakā,
which in turn tells us which melodies/chants it should be recited to.
Among the most popular metres is the śloka, which derives part of its popularity from its flexibility:
the table below lists the various possibilities of combinations of heavy and light syllables that are
permitted.
Of the four pādas of a śloka, 1+3 and 2+4 each follow the same pattern, meaning that the stanza
consists of two identically patterned lines (‘hemistichs’). Pādas 1 and 3 can furthermore follow the
‘normal’ (pathyā) or the ‘extended’ (vipulā) pattern.
For more details and a detailed list of examples of numerous Sanskrit metres, refer to the Appendix
in Apte’s Practical Sanskrit–English Dictionary (see above).
The symbol indicates that both a light and a heavy syllable can
appear in that position.

VEDIC SANSKRIT: A BRIEF INTRODUCTION
Vedic Sanskrit (or ‘Vedic’ in brief) differs from Classical Sanskrit on all language levels – sounds,
accent, word formation, semantics and syntax. This brief overview is meant to provide a general
idea of some of the differences between these two forms of the language.
Vedic has a small number of sounds that Classical Sanskrit does not have; and there are some
differences in internal and external sandhi (examples in the texts below). Some of its noun and
verb endings are different from those found in Classical Sanskrit, and it also has a larger number
of alternative forms (to give just two examples: in addition to the Classical infinitive in -tum, it
has a variety of other infinitive forms (all originally case forms of action nouns, most frequently
datives ending in -tavai and -dhyai); the ending of vowel-stem NomVocAcc Pl Ntr can be -āni/-
īni/-ūni, but also -ā/-ī/-ū, as well as shortened -a/-i/-u). Its verbal system has a larger number of
grammatical categories, such as separate optative and subjunctive moods (in Classical Sanskrit,
the potential mood has taken over the functions of both – or rather, the forms of the old optative
survive, but with the functions of both optative and subjunctive); optative as well as subjunctive
exist, furthermore, not only of the present tense, as the Classical potential does, but also of the
perfect and aorist. Vedic does not yet have a periphrastic future or perfect, and lacks the past active
participle formed by -ta-vant- (–› Chapter 25). It uses a number of words with different meanings
from those found in later texts, and also many words that are later not used at all; a number appear
just once in the entirety of the Ṛgveda. (Which, combined with the esoteric meaning of many of
the texts, makes understanding a number of Vedic hymns extremely difficult.) Perhaps the most
immediately noticeable syntactic difference is tmesis (lit. ‘cutting, separation’), as a result of which
preverbs stand separate from the verb they belong to, either in front of or also behind it (example
e.g. at Agni 1.2 below).
The Ṛgveda is written in verse. For the majority of verse types, this means that the number of syllables per line is fixed, and in some places certain sequences of light or heavy syllables (–› Chapter
2a) are required. Vowels (especially the augment, but also short vowels in endings) are sometimes
lengthened or shortened to make a word ‘fit’ the metre. Vedic has a ‘free’ pitch accent. ‘Free’ means
that the position of the accent cannot be predicted from the shape of the word; ‘pitch’ means that
the accented syllable was not pronounced more strongly, but at a higher pitch than the rest of the
word. In the Ṛgveda, the position of the accent is always explicitly indicated: the syllable preceding
the one accented is marked by means of a horizontal line underneath the writing (anudatta ‘not
raised’), the one following the accented syllable is indicated by means of a vertical line on top of the
writing (svarita ‘sounded’). The accented syllable itself (udatta ‘raised’) is not marked.
A proper summary of the differences between Vedic and Classical Sanskrit can be found in
e.g. A. A. Macdonell’s Sanskrit Grammar for Students, Appendix III (pp. 236–44). Vedic ac-

cent and metre are described e.g. in Macdonell’s Vedic Grammar for Students, Appendices II
(pp. 436–47) and III (pp. 448–69), respectively. What follows are brief excerpts from two of
the Ṛgveda’s more than 1,000 hymns, intended to exemplify at least some of the special features of Vedic mentioned above.
To Agni, the God of the Sacrificial Fire
अग्नि॒ मी॑ळे पु॒
रोहित॑ ं यज्ञ॒ स्य॑ दे॒वमृ॒
त्विजम् ॑ ।
होतारं ॑ रत्न॒धा त्न॒ त॑मम् ॥ १ ॥
ईळे ‘I praise’ (from √ईड् ‘to praise’: in Vedic, retroflex ḍ between vowels turns into ळ्, retroflex ḷ
(not to be confused with vocalic ḷ) – as is normal of Vedic verbs in main clauses that do not
stand at the beginning of the sentence or metrical unit, ईळे does not have an accent – पुरोहित-,
ऋत्विज्- and होतृ- are all terms for specific priests involved in the Vedic ritual. पुरोहित- lit. is the
one ‘placed in front, in charge of ’ and a term used of household or family priests; ऋत्विज्- is the
one ‘sacrificing (-ij- –> √yaj) at the right time (ṛtu-)’; होतृ-, one of the four main priests (from
√हु ‘to sacrifice’) is simply the ‘sacrificer’ – देवम् is used as an adjective ‘god-like, divine’ – note
that while standard English cannot form a superlative of an adjective such as रत्न-धा- ‘treasuregiving, ~-bestowing’, Sanskrit can.
अग्न॒ िः पूर्वे॑भि॒रषिृ भि॑ ॒रीडो॒
्य नूतनै॑ रु॒त ।
स दे॒वा एह व ँ ॑क्षति ॥ २ ॥
Note that पूर्वेभिः does not have the Instr Pl ending that in Classical Sanskrit is peculiar to a-stems,
but that used by all other noun stems – here देवाँ< देवान् Acc Pl Masc (Sanskrit final -ān/-īn/-
ūn/-ṝn may come from a variety of underlying forms; Vedic sandhi of -ān/-īn/-ūn/-ṝn reflects
this; the sandhi found here goes back to the earlier stage *-āṃs etc. of this specific ending) – एह
वक्षति < आ इह वक्षति (–› √वह्
) with tmesis of the preverb आ.
अग्नि॒ ना॑ र॒यिम॑श्नवत्पो ॒ ष॑मे॒व दि॒वेदिवे ॑ ।
यशसं ॒ ॑ व॒ीरव॑त्तमम् ॥ ३ ॥
अश्नवत is the 3 ् rd Sg Pres Pot of √अंश्/√अश् (V अश्नोति) ‘to get, obtain’, meaning ‘one should
obtain’ (the -a- that follows the Pres tense marker -no- is the Pot marker) – दि॒वेदिवे॑ is an
āṃreḍita compound meaning ‘day by day; every day’ – the accent of यशसं ॒ ॑ (yaśásam) shows
that this is not the noun yáśas- ‘fame, glory’ (which, furthermore, is neuter), but the adjective
yaśás- ‘glorious’ (modifying रयिम् and पोषम्).
380
II
ईड्य- (Adj) – ‘to be praised, praiseworthy’
(gerundive –› Chapter 33)
उत (Indc) – ‘and’
नूतन- (Adj) –‘current, present’
पूर्व- (Adj) – here ‘former, of old’
पोष- (m.) – ‘prosperity’
रयि- (m.) – ‘wealth’
वीर-वत्- (Adj) – ‘rich in heroes, having heroes’
(Agni do I invoke – the one placed to the fore, god and priest of the sacrifice, the Hotar,
most richly conferring treasure / Agni, to be invoked by ancient sages and the present
one – he will carry the gods here to this place. / By Agni one will obtain wealth and
prosperity every day, glorious and richest in heroes.)

Split up न असद आसीद ् न उ – ् in व्योमा, the final -ā has been lengthened for metrical purposes
(व्योमन्- is a neuter n-stem; but only if it is read as वि-ओमा does it have the right number of the
right syllables for the metre – आ-अवरीवः is the 3rd Sg Impf Intensive of आ-√वृत ‘to move, to ्
turn’ –› ‘it moved much, it moved back and forth’; the preverb ā is accented; the verb, as usual
for a main verb in a main clause, is not – कु ह ‘where’ is used in the Ṛgveda only (but compare
the parallel formation इ-ह ‘here’ which survives into Classical Sanskrit) – शर्मन् is an endingless
locative.

ा॒न्यन्न प॒रः किं च॒नास॑ ॥ २ ॥
अह्नः is the Gen Sg of अहर्- ‘day’, a so-called heteroclitic noun (meaning that its declensional
forms are drawn from more than one stem, अहर्- and अहन्-, respectively); maybe it is because
of this formal complexity that the word is increasingly replaced by formally simpler words
for ‘day’) – split up तस्मात् ह अन्यत् न, किं चन आस – तस्मात् अन्यत ‘other than this’ (A ् bl of
Comparison –› Chapter 9).

गूळ्ह- (Classical गूढ-) has aspirated retroflex -ḷh- for -ḍh- between vowels – split up सर्वम् आ;
आ is sandhied आः < *a-as-t, the 3rd Sg Impf of √अस्, with loss of -t to simplify the wordfinal consonant cluster (–› Chapter 21) and regular external sandhi of *-s > -ḥ. The more
recognisable form common later, आसीत, also is what is common in the ् Ṛgveda – अप्रकेत-
‘indiscriminate, unrecognisable’ is found only in this one hymn (yet its basis प्रकेत- is common,
hence we can easily identify its meaning) – महिना instead of Classical महिम्ना (weak stem of

LITERATURE INTRODUCTIONS
All Reading excerpts in this book were chosen from texts readily available through the Clay Sanskrit Library (New York: NYU Press/JJL Foundation, 2005–9).
The Pañcatantra (‘Five Chapters’ or ‘Five Principles’) is a collection of fables attributed to an author by the name of Viṣṇuśarma (of whom nothing, not even the period in which he lived, is
known). The form of the text that we have today stems from the third to sixth centuries AD, but it
is assumed that the roots of this collection go back much further. There are indications that these
tales were originally used in the education of future rulers, then later in the education of children in
general. The Pañcatantra was both popular and influential, thus being translated into Persian, and
from there on into Arabic, Greek, Hebrew, Latin and other languages. The stories are frequently
summed up by sayings that encapsulate a moral teaching or doctrine. Many of the Pañcatantra
readings in this book are such sayings.
The Hitopadeśa (hita-upadeśa- ‘Friendly Instruction’) is a collection of fables assembled within a
narrative frame: a king, disappointed by his sons’ lack of manners and erudition, sends them to a
sage, who tells them these stories, which are intended to simultaneously educate and entertain. As
is stated in the introduction, the Hitopadeśa draws on ‘the Pañcatantra and other sources’. Next to
nothing is known about the identity of the author mentioned in the text, Nārāyaṇa; as works that
can be dated to the eighth century AD are mentioned, the Hitopadeśa must have been composed at
some subsequent point (perhaps the ninth or tenth century).
The Rāmāyaṇa (Rāma-ayana: ‘Rāma’s Travels’) is the shorter of the two major Indian epics, traditionally attributed to the poet Vālmīki (who gives his own name in the poem); its majority was
probably composed in the fifth century BC. It describes the life of Rāma, his marriage to Sītā, her
abduction by the demon Rāvaṇa, Rāma’s (successful) efforts to get her back – efforts in which he
is aided by Hanumān, a monkey deputed by the monkey king Sugrīva to help Rāma – and Rāma
and Sītā’s life after they have been reunited. In telling the tale of Rāma, the Rāmāyaṇa illustrates the
character and actions of a virtuous man in all important situations in life.
The Mahābhārata (the ‘Great [Story] of the Bhāratas’, an important Aryan tribe, among them the
eponymous emperor Bharata, who is said to have been the first to unite India) is the longer of the
383
III
two major Indian epics (cf. the quotation on p. 17 of this book). It was probably first written down
between the fourth century BC and the fourth century AD, but is assumed to have its origins in
an oral tradition that dates back much further. According to Hindu tradition, it was dictated to
the elephant god Gaṇeśa by the sage Vyāsa in one long session. Its main plot concerns the conflict
between two sets of cousins, i.e. different branches of the same family: the Pāṇḍavas (the five sons
of their father, Pāṇḍu) and the Kauravas (the hundred ‘sons of Kuru’, the name of an important
royal dynasty in ancient northern India). Along the way, the Mahābhārata relates various stories
and discussions. Perhaps the most famous of these is the section commonly referred to as the
Bhagavad-Gītā, which touches on all major themes important to Hindu life.
In the Bhagavad-Gītā (the ‘Song of the Holy One’), a dialogue that is part of the Mahābhārata,
divine Kṛṣṇa outlines to the warrior Arjuna the principles of what is now Hindu thought: the
soul is immortal and thus superior to the material bodies in which it manifests itself in the cycle of rebirths; we therefore need to subordinate our bodily needs to those of our soul. Asked
more and more questions by Arjuna, Kṛṣṇa then goes on to explain different aspects of this basic
thought, and different ways in which we may live our life in accordance with it, giving proper
respect to ātman, the human soul, and brahman, the divine world soul. The Gītā, like the rest of
the Mahābhārata, is traditionally attributed to the sage Vyāsa; modern scholarship assumes that
it existed as an independent work before it was integrated into the ‘Great’ version of the Story of
the Bhāratas.
The Buddhacarita (or ‘Acts of the Buddha’) was written in the first or second century AD by
Aśvaghoṣa, a brahmin who had converted to Buddhism. Describing the life of the Buddha and
the world he was born into, it is an epic poem of which only a part (cantos (or chapters) 2–13 in
their entirety, 1 and 14 in part) survives in Sanskrit; the whole work (28 cantos) is preserved in a
Chinese translation from the fourth century AD. Writing in polished poetic kāvya style, Aśvaghoṣa
describes (and defends) Buddhism to the brahmins of which he had once been one.
Bhaṭṭikāvya (‘Bhaṭṭi’s Poem’) is a didactic (i.e. teaching) poem that exemplifies the rules of Sanskrit as
given by the grammarian Pāṇini’s Aṣṭādhyāyī (composed between the sixth and fourth centuries BC),
while at the same time retelling the events of the Rāmāyaṇa. Pāṇini uses an extremely condensed
technical/meta-language to express the rules of Sanskrit grammar as concisely as possible, and by
Bhaṭṭi’s lifetime (sixth/seventh century AD), a substantial set of commentaries existed, explaining
and exemplifying what Pāṇini meant by these rules. Bhaṭṭi, who first covers individual rules (‘sūtras’),
then goes on to write entire cantos/chapters on specific literary devices or grammatical categories
384
III
(e.g. the future, the aorist), and even writes one canto in such a way that it can be identified/read as
being both Sanskrit and Prakrit, is the only one to write such a commentary in poetic/kāvya form.
As in similar didactic works in other languages, interesting and/or beautiful language and the use of
metre make it easier to remember a text, and thus the rules it encapsulates.
Kālidāsa (who probably lived in the fifth century AD) is commonly regarded as the most skilful
writer of Sanskrit poetry and drama. His mahākāvya/court epic Kumārasaṃbhava (‘The birth of
Kumāra/the prince’) describes the circumstances of the birth and the life of Parvatī, the daughter of
the Himālaya, her romantic relationship with the god Śiva, and the birth of their son Kartikeya (the
eponymous Kumāra/prince). The artistry of Kālidāsa’s style, especially his use of compounds and
word-play/ambiguity, make his language difficult to understand for those still learning Sanskrit; for
this reason, only a few short excerpts of his works are included here.
The Āryāsaptaśatī (‘Seven Hundred Āryās’, i.e. 700 short poems written in āryā (lit. ‘noble, elegant’) metre) was composed by Govardhana, a court poet in twelfth-century Bengal. Grouped by
their initial letter, each poem stands on its own, containing a brief observation or description of
moments in human relationships (in the large majority, romantic relationships). Many of these
brief poems thrive on śleṣa (ambiguity/word-play), which sometimes pervades the meaning of
entire sentences. The selections in this textbook had to be made from among those with more
straightforward language and minimal or no word-play, but more advanced students are encouraged to return to the Āryāsaptaśatī later and get a taste of śleṣa in small and self-contained doses.
The Nītiśataka (‘One Hundred [Verses] on nīti’; √nī ‘to lead’ –› nīti- ‘leading (either yourself or others): conduct; politics’) forms one-third of the Śatakatraya (‘Triplet of One-Hundred-[Verse] Sets’),
a collection of 3 x 100 short, self-contained poems on worldly conduct, passion and dispassion/
renunciation, respectively, attributed to Bhartṛhari. (Next to nothing is known of the author; yet the
collection is commonly attributed to the fourth century AD.) While the emphasis on renunciation
may be specifically Indian, many of these poems encapsulate thoughts, challenges or precepts that
affect people everywhere, and across time.
The Śāntivilāsaḥ (‘Manifestation of Peace’) is a collection of brief, self-contained poems by
Nīlakaṇṭha, a member of a family of intellectuals, living in the sixteenth century in what is now the
Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The poems offer acerbic and witty reflections on religious and societal
expectations – on dharma – and reveal the author’s own deeply critical stance on matters such as
faith, life, death or happiness. They are eerily modern in many ways.

SANDHI
(Numbers indicate chapter of introduction.)
Sanskrit words regularly change their pronunciation when they stand together with other
words. Sanskrit spelling marks all these changes. This process is called external sandhi, and
its general principles are quite simple:
1) The last sound of a word changes, depending on the first sound of the next word. Sometimes, that first sound also changes.
2) A consonant at the end of a word becomes more similar to the first sound of the next
word.
3) A vowel at the end of a word interacts (and often merges) with a following vowel, but
remains the same when a consonant follows.

1
 When word-final -n (or more rarely, -ṅ) is preceded by a short vowel and the next word begins
with a vowel, the -n/ṅ doubles: smayan iva –› smayann iva.
2
 Exception: -aḥ + a- –› -o ऽ-: naraḥ asti –› naro ’sti (नरो ऽस्ति).
3
 Between a word-final -n and any initial sound that is formed using the tongue (c-/ch-, ṭ-/ṭh-, t-
/th-), an s-sound is inserted. Before the palatal c/ch, the palatal ś is added; before the retroflex ṭ/ṭh,
a retroflex ṣ, and before dental t/th, a dental s. Before the s-sound, the n turns into anusvāra ṃ:
kasmin cit –› kasmiṃś cit.
4
 While sandhi primarily affects the word-final sounds, there are a few cases in which the initial sound of the next word is also affected: agacchat hi –› agacchad dhi. The new forms of these
word-initial sounds are given in brackets after the sandhied word-final consonants in the grid.
5
 If a short vowel precedes, that vowel is lengthened. E.g. बुद्धिः रक्षति buddhiḥ rakṣati –› बुद्धी रक्षति
buddhī rakṣati ‘Wisdom protects.’
6
 The sign used above the l is the anunāsika. Its devanāgarī representation is◌ँ, and it is pronounced
like an anusvāra, yet it nasalises consonants, not vowels. (Pronounce it by pronouncing an l while
at the same time producing the hum-like nasalised sound of the anusvāra.)

390
III
Exceptions to external sandhi
1) The Nom Sg Masc saḥ/eṣah appears as sa/eṣa in all positions except before a- (where saḥ/eṣaḥ
+ a- results in so/eṣo ’- through sandhi; –› e.g. सः अस्ति saḥ asti –› सो ऽस्ति so ‘sti).
2) A small number of ‘uncombinable’ final vowels in specific words and word forms do not merge
with the following initial vowels. These are the long -ī, -ū and -e of dual endings, the N Pl Masc
अमी (from अदस्, see Chapter 39) and the final vowels of interjections such as ā, he, aho ‘ah!,
oh!’. (These vowels are called pragṛhya (lit.) ‘to be taken on their own’.)
Sandhi and Writing Conventions
There are two conditions under which Sanskrit words have to be combined in writing.
– Whenever a final vowel merges with an identical initial vowel. (As can be seen from the table
above, final aˉ˘ ıˉ˘ ū˘ ṛ au merge with any following initial vowel. As a result, the gap between the
two words in question is lost: कन्या अस्ति kanyā asti –› कन्यास्ति kanyāsti.)
– Whenever a word ends in a consonant and a virāma would thus have to be used otherwise:
अन्यत् फलम्anyat phalam –› अन्यत्फलम्anyatphalam, अन्यद अन्नम् ् anyad annam –› अन्यदन्नम्
anyadannam, अस्ति अन्नम्asti annam –› अस्त अन्नम् ्य् asty annam –› अस्त्यन्नम्astyannam.
Note: After final visarga -ḥ and anusvāra -ṃ, words are not joined in writing.
2) Internal Sandhi
We notice the workings of internal sandhi whenever something (such as a preverb, a reduplicative
syllable, an infix, a suffix or an ending) is added to a word form. Like external sandhi, internal sandhi usually works from right to left: a sound is affected by the sound that follows directly upon it,
not the other way around. (See immediately below for the three major exceptions to this.) Much
of internal sandhi is similar to external sandhi, and the basic principle is the same: consonants become more similar, thus making words easier to pronounce; vowels merge with identical vowels; a
forms complex vowels (e ai o au), the other vowels turn into their consonantal counterparts.
Three cases of internal sandhi in which a sound affects what follows (rather than being affected
by it):
a) Retroflexion of s (Ruki Rule) (9)
s turns into ṣ
immediately after r, k or any vowel other than a or ā
unless that s stands at the end of a word, or is followed by r
and even if that intervening vowel is followed by anusvāra (ṃ) or visarga (ḥ)

‘Hanuman pierced the hides of the horses yoked to the shafts of Indrajit’s chariot and
took their lives.’
(Bhaṭṭikāvya, 9.67, transl. Clay Sanskrit Library – see note on p. 6 above)
Notice s > ṣ after i (dviṣ), r (dhūrṣu), u in spite of intervening ṃ (āyuṃsi) and after k
(tvakṣu), and s remaining as s after a (yānasya).
n turns into ṇ
after r, ṛ, ṝ and ṣ anywhere within the same word
unless the n is followed by a stop
or unless a dental, palatal or retroflex stop, or s or ś, stands anywhere between the two.
Thus we get maraṇa- and viṣaṇṇa-, but darśana- (a palatal intervenes between r and n) and kṣantum- (the n is followed by t).
c) Buddha Sandhi (8)
voiced aspirate + t –› voiced unaspirated + voiced aspirated dh:
dh + t results in ddh (e.g. √budh –› buddha-)
bh + t results in bdh (e.g. √labh –› labdha-)
h + t results in gdh (e.g. √dah –› dagdha-)
Thus we get nareṣu, cakṣūṃṣi, haviḥṣu (s –> ṣ after a vowel other than a, even if ḥ or ṃ interfere)
but senāsu (the e in the word does not directly precede the s) and haviḥ (word-final s appears as
visarga).
In the Bhaṭṭikāvya, a retelling of the Rāmāyaṇa that at the same time serves to illustrate the rules
of the grammar of Pāṇini, the following śloka exemplifies ruki:

III
Some frequent instances of internal sandhi worth mentioning here:
– Internal sandhi of vowels is mostly identical to external vowel sandhi (see the table on p. 389
above), with the following exceptions:
– in root ī- and ū-stems (cf. Chapter 13) and in verb forms where this avoids clusters of more
than two consonants, ī/ū + vowel –› -iy-/-uv- (rather than ī/ū –› y/v)
– the treatment of e, o and ai before another vowel: external e –› a, o –› a (except before a-,
where both remain as they are and the a is dropped), ai vs. ā, as opposed to internal e –› ay,
o –› av, ai –› āy.
– Before s (athematic verbs, future tense, desideratives, Loc Pl): stops lose their voicing and/or
aspiration, and palatals become velars; after a velar, s turns into ṣ according to ruki (e.g. √yuj ‘to
join’: 3rd Sg Fut Act *yoj-sya-ti > *yoc-syati > *yok-syati > yokṣyati ‘he will join’). ś turns into k,
also turning the following s into ṣ according to ruki (e.g. √dṛś ‘to see’: 3rd Sg Fut Act drakṣyati ‘he
will see’). Rarely, s turns into t: √vas ‘to dwell’ –› 3rd Sg Fut vat-syati); before the Loc Pl ending,
it turns into visarga (e.g. *manas-su > manaḥsu). h turns into k (e.g. √dah ‘to burn’ –› dakṣyati
‘he will burn’). In some cases of lost aspiration (including h > k) in verbs, the closest preceding
consonant may become aspirated; this change is not predictable, and the affected forms must be
memorised together with the respective verbs (e.g. √budh ‘to awake’ –› 3rd Sg Fut Act bhotsyate
‘he will awaken’).
– Before t (ta-participles, absolutives in -tvā, -tya, infinitives in -tum): stops lose their voice or
aspiration: √chid ‘cut off ’ chittvā ‘having cut off ’. (But on voiced aspirates: note buddha sandhi
above!) Palatals, furthermore, become velars (√yuj ‘to join, link’ –› yukta- ‘having been joined’).
ś changes into ṣ, and after this ṣ, t changes into ṭ (√dṛś ‘to see’ –› dṛṣṭa- ‘having been seen’).
– After ṣ, t turns into ṭ (e.g. √sthā ‘to stand’: 3rd Pres Act tiṣṭhati with s > ṣ through ruki, and t > ṭ
after ṣ).
– Nasals before consonants: Within words, nasals sometimes appear as stops (ṅ ñ ṇ n m), sometimes as anusvāra ṃ. Over time, and across written and oral traditions, there is some variation
as to which option (nasal stop or anusvāra) is employed. This book uses the following distribution: before a stop, a nasal appears as the ‘homorganic’ nasal stop, i.e. as the velar nasal ṅ before
another velar stop, as the palatal ñ before a palatal stop, and so on: gantum, yuñjmaḥ, yuṅktaḥ
etc. Before consonants that are not stops (y r l v, ś ṣ s, h), nasals appear as anusvāra ṃ: manāṃsi,
svayaṃvaraḥ. An exception to this is made for the preverb/prefix sam-, which appears as saṃwhen any kind of consonant follows.
All other relevant instances of internal sandhi are discussed within their contexts (i.e. mostly in the
chapters on the various noun stems).

an-stems: Strong stem in vṛddhi, except Voc Sg (guṇa). If more than one consonant precedes the -an-,
the weak stem has -an-; if only one consonant precedes, the weak stem has -n-.
in-stems: ‘Having x’ if added to nouns; ‘regularly doing x’ if added to verbal root (usually in guṇa or
vṛddhi). Feminines add -ī: gāminī- ‘going’.
in-/an-stem adjectives: Identical to the corresponding noun forms in each gender.

ADJECTIVES: COMPARATIVES AND SUPERLATIVES
There are two ways of forming comparatives and superlatives of adjectives:
1) Add -tara- or -tama- to stem: e.g. śīghra- ‘fast’ – śīghratara- ‘faster’ – śīghratama- ‘fastest’.
2) Rarer: add -(ī)yas- or -iṣṭha- to often unpredictable form of adjective stem: e.g. guru- ‘heavy’ – gariyas- ‘heavier’ – gariṣṭha- ‘heaviest’;
comparative has -(ī)yāṃs- in strong cases, -(ī)yas- in weak cases, -(ī)yan in Voc S
g M
asc; feminines are formed by adding -ī to the weak stem.

b) Athematic (18, 19):
Strong stem (usually guṇa) in Pres and Impf Act Sg (+ Impv of all 1st persons Act and Mid and 3rd Sg Act); weak stem (zero grade) everywhere else.
In Class II verbs, endings are added directly to the root, which stands in guṇa (strong) or zero grade (weak). No additional affixes
are used.
Example: √i ‘to go’: 1st Sg emi ‘I go’, 1st Pl imaḥ ‘we go’.
In Class III verbs, the root is reduplicated (see below on reduplication). No other affixes are added. The root stands in guṇa
(strong) or zero grade (weak).
Example: √hu ‘sacrifice’: 1st Sg juhomi, 1st Pl juhumaḥ.
Class V roots add the suffix -no- (strong)/-nu- (weak).
Example: √āp ‘obtain, get’: 1st Sg āpnomi, 1st Pl āpnumaḥ.
Class VII roots add -na-/-n- as an infix into the verbal root, directly before the root-final consonant.
Example: √rudh ‘to hinder’: 1st Sg ruṇadhmi, 1st Pl rundhmaḥ.
Class VIII roots add strong -o-/weak -u-.
Example: √tan ‘to stretch’: 1st Sg tanomi, 1st Pl tanumaḥ.
(As most of the few existing Class VIII roots end in -n, they effectively look identical to Class V verbs.)
Class IX roots add the suffix -nā- in the strong forms, -nī- in weak forms whose endings begin with a consonant, and -n- in weak
forms whose endings begin with a vowel (i.e. in the 3rd Pl).
Example: √krī ‘to buy’: 1st Sg krīṇāmi, 1st Pl krīṇīmaḥ, 3rd Pl krīṇanti.

Notes:
All athematic classes: 3rd Pl Pres Act -anti, 1st Sg Impf Act -am: the presence of this -a- prevents certain sandhi and keeps these endings
recognisable. – 2nd+ 3rd Du in Impf and Impv middle: -āthām/-ātām with long -ā- (thematic: -ethām/-etām). – Relevant internal sandhi: –›
Chapter 18. Cf. Chapter 19 for a list of noteworthy and exceptional paradigms.
Class III: 3rd Pl Pres Act: -ati rather than -anti. – 3rd Pl Impf Act: -uḥ rather than -an.
Class V: In 1st Du and Pl, both -nvaḥ/-nuvaḥ and -nmaḥ/-numaḥ are possible unless a stop precedes (and thus only -nuvaḥ/-numaḥ are
pronounceable). – Class V roots ending in a consonant have 2nd Sg Impv in -hi (as other athematic verbs); Class V roots ending in a vowel use
the weak stem for this form (as thematic verbs do; –› e.g. √vṛ –› vṛṇu ‘cover!’).
GR
THE PERFECT (27, 28)
The perfect has its own set of endings, which are added to the strong reduplicated stem in the active singular, and the weak reduplicated stem
elsewhere.

Exception: verbal roots in -ā have -au as 1st + 3rd Sg Act ending.
(i)’s in brackets are present when a consonant precedes, absent
if a vowel precedes (sometimes absent in 2nd Sg Act even if a
consonant precedes).
Perfect reduplication: Vowel reduplicated by its short counterpart; consonant reduplicated identically, except: aspirated –› unaspirated; velar –› palatal (incl. h –› j); clusters: only first consonant; except if s + stop –› only stop. (See Chapter 27 for details.)

(3) Same as in 2, but of a root cited in guṇa.
(4) Verb with -a- + only one consonant in guṇa: vṛddhi of root used in 3rd S
g and potentially 1st S
g.
(5) Root with -a- and identically reduplicating consonant: alternative weak stem (no reduplication, a > e).
(6) Alternative endings due to stem-final -ā.
(7) Frequently used paradigm with irregular reduplicative vowel and without stem gradation (stem = babhūv- throughout).
–› See Chapter 34 on the periphrastic perfect of derived verbs and verbal roots with a long initial vowel.
407
GR
OTHER PARTS OF THE VERB
Passive voice (21): The present tense forms its passive voice by combining the weak
root + -ya- + middle endings. Root-final vowels change:
i, u > ī, ū; ā > ī, ṛ > ri (after more than one consonant: ar); ṝ > īr,
after labials ūr.
Examples: √yaj ‘to sacrifice’ –› ijye, ijyase, ijyate etc.; √dā ‘to give’ –› dīyate; √tṝ
‘to cross’ –› tīryate
In all other tenses, the passive is formally identical to the middle.
Context helps us tell the two apart.
Future tense (21): -sya- or -iṣya- are added to the root in guṇa. Internal sandhi before
s: devoicing, deaspiration; palatals > velars; s > ḥ; ś, ṣ > k.
Examples: √gam ‘to go’: gaṃsyati or gamiṣyati, √dṛś ‘to see’: drakṣyati
Periphrastic future (29): An alternative future is formed by adding the forms of √as ‘to be’
to an agent noun in the Nom Sg. The 3rd-person forms use an agent
noun in the respective number without a form of √as.
Example: √nī to lead’: netāsmi ‘I will lead’, netāsi, netā – netāsvaḥ, netāsthaḥ,
netārau – netāsmaḥ, netāstha, netārāḥ.
Periphrastic perfect (33): Roots not clearly recognisable in the regular perfect (e.g. causatives,
and by extension also Class X roots), and roots in which a regular
reduplication is not recognisable as such (i.e. roots with initial
long vowels) form an alternative perfect by taking the present
stem, adding -ām and a perfect form of ‘to be’ (āsa, babhūva) or the
perfect active or middle of √kṛ (cakāra, cakre).
Examples: √bhṛ ‘to carry’ –› causative bhārayati ‘he causes to carry’ –›
periphrastic perfect bharayām āsa ‘he caused to carry’
√ās ‘to sit’ –› ās-ām āsa ‘he sat’, āsāṃ cakrire ‘they sat’.
Aorist (38): See chapter for forms.
Secondary Formations
Causative (7): Adding -aya- to a verbal root outside of Class X strengthened
to at least guṇa creates the meaning of ‘to cause someone to do
something’.
Examples: √nī ‘to lead’ –› (I) nayati ‘leads’ –› nāyayati ‘causes to lead’; √dṛś ‘to
see’ –› darṣayati ‘causes to see, shows’
408
GR
Desiderative (34): Adding -sa- or -iṣa- to a reduplicated root creates the meaning of
‘to want to do x’. Before -sa-, the root usually stands in zero grade;
before -iṣa- usually in guṇa. Consonants are reduplicated as usual
(cf. p. 410), vowels as follows: u/ū reduplicates as u, everything else
as i.
Examples: √yudh ‘to fight’ –› yuyutsate ‘wants to fight’; √pā ‘to drink’ –›
pipāsati ‘wants to drink’; NB √āp ‘to get’ –› īpsati ‘wants to get’ or
simply ‘wants’.
Nominal Formations from Verbs
(For sandhi before t, see relevant section of ‘Internal Sandhi’ above.)
Participles: Present active (25): -(a)nt-/-(a)t- added to present stem (athematic: weak stem).
Class III: only -at-.
Examples: √nī –› nayant- ‘leading’; √dhā –› dadhat- ‘giving’.
Present middle (22): Thematic -māna-, athematic -āna- added to present stem
(athematic: weak stem).
Examples: √yudh –› yudhyamāna- ‘fighting’; √yuj –› yuñjāna- ‘linking’;
but NB √ās –› āsīna- ‘sitting’.
Future participles (25): Formed from future stem with same suffixes as present
participles.
Examples: Act √gam –› gamiṣyant- ‘about to go’; Mid/Pass √yudh –›
yotsyamāna- ‘about to fight/be fought’.
Perfect active (35): -vāṃs-/-vad- (weak before cons.)/-uṣ- (weak before vowel)
added to weak perfect stem.
Examples: √tud –›tutudvat- ‘having struck’; note √vid- –› vidvat- ‘knowing’ (without reduplication).
Perfect middle: -āna- added to the weak perfect stem.
Examples: √kṛ–› cakrāṇa- ‘having done’, √vip –› vepāna- ‘shaking,
trembling’.
ta/na-participle (8, 34): -ta- added to zero-grade root. Meaning: usually past;
passive whenever possible, otherwise active.
Examples: √han –› hata- ‘having been killed’; √gam –› gata- ‘having gone’.
A small number of roots (usually ending in -d or a vowel) use -na- rather
than -ta- (34).
Examples: √sad –› sanna- ‘seated’; √tṝ –› tīrṇa- ‘having crossed’.
tavant-participle (25): adds -vant- to ta-participle, declined like vant-/mant-stems.
Past active meaning.
Example: √likh –› likhitavant- ‘having written’.

GR
Feminines in -ī formed of the following: Pres Act Ptc (strong stem of thematic, weak stem of
athematic verbs (e.g. nayantī-/dadhatī-);
weak (prevocalic) stem of Perf Act Ptc (e.g. viduṣī-); weak stem of tavant-participle (e.g. likhitavatī-).
Absolutive (8): Adding -tvā (compound verbs: -tya after short vowels, -ya elsewhere) to the
root in zero grade results in the meaning of ‘having done x’. Indeclinable.
Examples: kṛtvā ‘having done’; gatvā ‘having gone’, apagamya or apagatya ‘having gone
away’; uktvā ‘having said’ (–› √vac).
Gerundive (34): Root in various grades plus -(t)ya-, root in guṇa plus -tavya- or -anīya-, plus
case ending. Meaning: passive necessity.
Examples: √kṛ –› kartavya- ‘having to be done’; √śru –› śrutya- ‘having to be heard’.
Infinitive (8): Adding -tum to the root in guṇa results in the meaning ‘to do x’. Infinitives are
usually used after verbs such as ‘to want, to wish (to do something)’ etc.
Examples: √bhṛ –› bhartum ‘to carry’; √nī –› netum ‘to lead’; √dṛś –› draṣṭum ‘to see’.

REDUPLICATION
Reduplication is found in Class III verbs (Chapter 18), the perfect tense (Chapter 27), desiderative
verbs (Chapter 34) and in a small number of present tense stems (e.g. √sthā, √pā). Reduplicating a
root means taking the first consonant and first vowel and adding them to the front of that root: of
√takṣ ‘to construct, fashion’, for example, the reduplicated form is ta-takṣ-. Both consonants and
vowels do not always reduplicate identically. The rules for consonant reduplication are the same
wherever reduplication occurs (a). The rules of vowel reduplication vary (b).
a) Consonants
Aspirated consonants are reduplicated without the aspiration: √dhā ‘to put’ –› da-dhā-.
Velar consonants are reduplicated as palatals: √kṛ ‘do’ –› ca-kṛ-.
h, frequently representing original *gh, is reduplicated as j: √hu ‘to sacrifice, pour’ –› ju-hu-.
In consonant clusters, only the first consonant is repeated: √kram ‘to stride’ –› ca-kram- (with
palatal instead of velar). Exception: if the cluster consists of s plus stop, it is only the stop
that is repeated. (√sthā ‘to stand’–› ti-ṣṭha- (with retroflex -ṣṭ- according to ruki)).
b) Vowels:
Class III: Short vowels are reduplicated identically; long vowels with their short counterpart:
√dā ‘to give’ –› reduplicated da-dā-.
Perfect: Roots that contain i/ī or u/ū have -i- or -u- as their reduplicative vowel, respectively:
√śru –› śu-śru-, √kṣip –›ci-kṣip-. In all other cases, the reduplicative vowel is -a-:
√kṛ –› ca-kṛ-; √dā –› da-dā-. Irregular: √bhū –› ba-bhūDesideratives: u/ū reduplicates as u, everything else as i: √yudh ‘to fight’: yu-yut-sa-te; √pā ‘to
drink’ –› pi-pā-sa-ti.
