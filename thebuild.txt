Phase 1: Mode 1 + user profile tracking. This is the whole game honestly.

# This is the feedback loop that actually teaches
async def session(audio, target, profile):
    heard = await whisper(audio, lang="sa")
    errors = diff(target, heard)
    
    # Update persistent weakness model
    for err in errors:
        confusion_type = PHONEME_CONFUSIONS.get(err)
        profile["errors"][confusion_type] = profile["errors"].get(confusion_type, 0) + 1
    
    # Spaced repetition: surface worst phoneme more
    # When Whisper stops confusing it → learner fixed it
    return feedback(errors, profile)
The user profile is your acoustic model. 50 sessions of confusion data tells you more about that specific learner than GOP scores on a model that's never heard Sanskrit.
Phase 2: Vowel duration as a special case.
Vowel length (ā vs a) is actually measurable without a Sanskrit acoustic model. It's literally a timing measurement — you can detect it with librosa on the raw audio:
pythondef check_vowel_length(audio_segment, phoneme):
    # Get duration of the vowel segment
    duration_ms = len(audio_segment) / sample_rate * 1000
    
    if phoneme in ["ā", "ī", "ū"] and duration_ms < 120:
        return "vowel_length"  # Long vowel said too short
    return None
This is the one place where a simple acoustic measurement is reliable and doesn't need a trained model. Worth adding.

The actual MVP
Want me to write the full local Python server? It'd be:

FastAPI endpoint that takes audio + target_text
Sanskrit Whisper transcription
Phoneme diff against target
Vowel duration check via librosa
User profile update + weakness tracking
indic-parler-tts response in Sanskrit + English gloss
Spaced repetition drill selector based on profile

Probably ~400 lines total. Everything runs locally on your 12GB. The GOP stuff can come later if you actually validate that the alignment model works for Sanskrit — but I'd bet you get 80% of the pedagogical value from Mode 1 alone.web search to confirm this is the best stack and it cant be improved on any more easily, whisper x etc similar4:43 AMSearched the webSearched the webSanskrit ASR pronunciation assessment 2024 202510 resultsFull article: I Can Speak: improving English pronunciation through automatic speech recognition-based language learning systemswww.tandfonline.comSanskrit | Pronunciation in Englishdictionary.cambridge.orgAutomatic Pronunciation Assessment - A Reviewaclanthology.orgCBSE Class 10 Sanskrit Question Paper 2024 with Answer Keycollegedunia.comAutomatic Speech Recognition for Sanskrit with Transfer Learningarxiv.orgInnovative approaches to English pronunciation instruction in ESL contexts: integration of multi-sensor detection and advanced algorithmic feedback - PMCpmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.govLinguistically Informed Post-processing for ASR Error correction in Sanskrit | Request PDFwww.researchgate.netFull article: A systematic literature review of research on automatic speech recognition in EFL pronunciationwww.tandfonline.comPronunciation of Sanskrit Letters | our sanskritoursanskrit.comCBSE Class 10 Sanskrit Question Paper 2025 PDF with Solutionswww.vedantu.comAI4Bharat Sanskrit Whisper finetuned model huggingface 202410 resultsai4bharat (AI4Bharat)huggingface.coAI4Bharat Modelsmodels.ai4bharat.orgai4bharat/indic-seamless · Hugging Facehuggingface.coai4bharat/indic-parler-tts · Hugging Facehuggingface.coai4bharat/Airavata · Hugging Facehuggingface.coparthiv11/indic_whisper_nodcil · Hugging Facehuggingface.coai4bharat/vits_rasa_13 · Hugging Facehuggingface.coWhisper model fine tuning - Models - Hugging Face Forumsdiscuss.huggingface.coai4bharat/indic-bert · Hugging Facehuggingface.coAI4Bharat and Hugging Face Released Indic Parler-TTS: A Multimodal Text-to-Speech Technology for Multilingual Inclusivity and Bridging India's Linguistic Digital Divide - MarkTechPostwww.marktechpost.comSanskrit whisper finetuned model huggingface Vaksamcayah 2024 202510 resultsWhisper model fine tuning - Models - Hugging Face Forumsdiscuss.huggingface.coFine-tuning on a new language?

Here's the actual picture based on what's out there:
The stack is mostly right, but you missed something important: IndicMFA
The biggest find: AI4Bharat built IndicMFA — a Sanskrit forced alignment model trained on 76 hours of Sanskrit data, using a grapheme-to-grapheme (G2G) approach instead of the traditional grapheme-to-phoneme pipeline. GitHub This is a direct drop-in for the alignment problem you were worried about. No IPA transliteration hack needed.
That changes Mode 2 from "probably skip it" to "actually buildable" — though it still adds significant complexity.
The confirmed stack
ASR: The Whisper Sanskrit finetuning situation is real but fragmented. A January 2025 paper achieved 15.42% WER on the Vāksañcayaḥ dataset using Whisper transfer learning arXiv, and there's a published model (Bidwill/whisper-medium-sanskrit-try-2 on HuggingFace). Not AI4Bharat quality, but it exists. The more important point from that paper: WER may not fully capture Sanskrit nuances, especially where sandhi creates variant spellings that convey the same meaning arXiv — which is actually fine for your use case, because ASR confusion is your signal, not perfect transcription.
TTS: indic-parler-tts officially supports Sanskrit with emotion rendering including Command, Anger, Narration, and others Hugging Face. Confirmed. Evaluation scores show near-perfect synthesis for Sanskrit specifically. MarkTechPost That's unusually good news.
Forced alignment (the key update): IndicMFA exists with 76 hours of Sanskrit training data. This means WhisperX + IndicMFA is a viable path for Mode 2, not a research project. The WhisperX codebase itself confirms: you can pass any Hugging Face wav2vec2 model as the alignment model via --align_model GitHub — IndicMFA slots right in.
An alternative alignment path also exists: You can do multilingual forced alignment without a language-specific model by romanizing the transcript with the uroman package and passing it to PyTorch's multilingual wav2vec2 tutorial GitHub. IAST is essentially uroman for Sanskrit — this is the IPA workaround from your original docs, and it actually works.
Revised verdict on the modes
Mode 1 (Whisper confusion diagnostic): Still build this first. Still the right call. The architecture is sound.
Mode 2 (forced alignment + GOP): Now actually feasible. IndicMFA solves the alignment problem that was the main blocker. The GOP scoring on top of it is still the risky part — you'd need wav2vec2-xlsr or similar as the acoustic model for phoneme likelihoods, and Sanskrit-specific calibration is unclear. But the alignment itself is no longer a research problem.
WhisperX vs MFA directly: MFA produces more accurate word-level timestamps than WhisperX for forced alignment specifically GitHub. If you're doing Mode 2 for pronunciation assessment (where phoneme boundary accuracy matters), consider using IndicMFA via MFA directly rather than through the WhisperX wrapper — it's the tool built for this job.

What this means practically: Mode 2 is buildable without a research project. The sequence is now: IndicMFA for alignment → extract phoneme segments → MFCC distance vs TTS reference → you still don't have a Sanskrit acoustic model for proper GOP, but the MFCC comparison alone gives you acoustic evidence without needing one. That's actually a cleaner architecture.
Build Mode 1 first. When it's working, add IndicMFA alignment for the vowel duration and boundary cases where Whisper confusion alone isn't specific enough.
